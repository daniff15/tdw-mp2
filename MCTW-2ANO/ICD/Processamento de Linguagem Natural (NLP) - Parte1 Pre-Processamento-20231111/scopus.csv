However, programming languages, computational tools, and methods for exploring and analyzing data can be time consuming and frustrating to learn and finding help with these stages of the broader research process can be daunting. In this work, we highlight the impacts that computational research support programs housed in library contexts can have for fulfilling gaps in student, staff, and faculty research needs. The archival history of one such organization, Software and Services for Data Science (SSDS) in the Stanford University Cecil H. Green Library, is used to outline challenges faced by social sciences and humanities researchers from the 1980s to the present day. To compliment this history, participation metrics from consulting services (1999–2021) and workshops (2000–2021) are presented along with updated workshop participant feedback forms (n = 99) and further illustrate the profound impacts that these services can have for helping researchers succeed. Consulting and workshop metrics indicate that SSDS has supported at least 27,031 researchers between 1999 and 2021 (average of more than 1175 per year). A t-test on the feedback form data indicates that participant knowledge in workshops statistically significantly increased more than one scale point from workshop start to completion. Results also indicate that despite our successes, many past challenges continue to present barriers regardless of exponential advances in computing, teaching, and learning—specifically around learning to access data and learning the software and tools to use it. We hope that our story helps other institutions understand how indispensable computational research support is within the library. © The Author(s) 2022.",Archival research; computational research support; data collection; data science; metadata,,English,Article,Article in press,,Scopus

CSS is an emerging discipline that integrates data science methods with social science theories and research designs. However, undergraduate social science students could face a lack of a sense of STEM identity or belonging. Also, compared to STEM majors in natural science or engineering, average undergraduate social science students come in with limited mathematical or statistical knowledge. The OERs developed and tested in this article are designed with pedagogical frameworks that help overcome these barriers faced by students from diverse backgrounds and offer students a jump-start in learning CSS.

The predictions in learning analytics are made to enhance the effectiveness of educational interferences. This study predicts student engagement at an early phase of a Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) course by analyzing data collected from consecutive years. The prediction model is developed using machine learning techniques applied to a subset of Open University Learning Analytics Dataset, provided by Open University (OU), Britain. The investigated data belongs to 7,775 students who attended social science courses for consecutive assessment years. The experiments are conducted with a reduced feature set to predict whether the students are highly or lowly engaged in the courses. The attributes indicating students' interaction with the VLE, their scores, and final results are the most contributing variables for the predictive analysis. Based on these variables, a reduced feature vector is constructed. The baseline used in the study is the linear regression model. The model’s best results showed 95% accurate, 95% precise, and 98% relevant results with the Random Forest classification algorithm. Early prediction’s relevant features are a subset of click activities, which provided a functional interface between the students and the VLE. © The Author(s) 2022.",Data science applications in education; distance education and online learning; distributed learning environments,,English,Article,Final,,Scopus

Yet, the uptake and success of large-scale mobile health research in the last decade have not met this intensely promoted opportunity. We make the argument that digital person-generated health data are required and necessary to answer many top priority research questions, using illustrative examples taken from the James Lind Alliance Priority Setting Partnerships. We then summarize the findings from 2 UK initiatives that considered the challenges and possible solutions for what needs to be done and how such solutions can be implemented to realize the future opportunities of digital person-generated health data for clinically important population health research. Examples of important areas that must be addressed to advance the field include digital inequality and possible selection bias; easy access for researchers to the appropriate data collection tools, including how best to harmonize data items; analysis methodologies for time series data; patient and public involvement and engagement methods for optimizing recruitment, retention, and public trust; and methods for providing research participants with greater control over their data. There is also a major opportunity, provided through the linkage of digital person-generated health data to routinely collected data, to support novel population health research, bringing together clinician-reported and patient-reported measures. We recognize that well-conducted studies need a wide range of diverse challenges to be skillfully addressed in unison (eg, challenges regarding epidemiology, data science and biostatistics, psychometrics, behavioral and social science, software engineering, user interface design, information governance, data management, and patient and public involvement and engagement). Consequently, progress would be accelerated by the establishment of a new interdisciplinary community where all relevant and necessary skills are brought together to allow for excellence throughout the life cycle of a research study. This will require a partnership of diverse people, methods, and technologies. If done right, the synergy of such apartnership has the potential to transform many millions of people's lives for the better. © 2023 Journal of Medical Internet Research.

Interactions consisting of surfing behaviour in the Virtual Learning Environment (VLE) among two different groups of students namely disabled and non-disabled students for Social Science and STEM courses are analysed. Predictive analytics and association rule mining (ARM) analysis are performed. Predictive analytics is performed to predict students’ likelihood of withdrawing from their registered courses. Among the students who choose to pursue their registered courses, predictive analytics is also used to predict at-risk students. Six predictive algorithms namely Decision Tree (DT), Logistic Regression (LR), Naive Bayes (NB), K Nearest Neighbour (KNN), Random Forest (RF), and Support Vector Machine (SVM) are compared. FP-Growth algorithm is applied in ARM analysis. Predictive results show that DT is superior with the accuracy scores reaching 0.91. Most association rules are positively correlated, and they represent the set of commonly surfed pages by the potential at-risk and withdrawal students. The predictive results can help VLE developer to determine the possible algorithms to be used in the intelligent VLE to make accurate predictions based on students’ interactions in the VLE. The results from ARM analysis prove that FP-Growth can also be included in the intelligent VLE. The intelligent VLE can assist the relevant staff in an education institution to provide timely and personalized support to students who are struggling in their studies.

Hence, this study investigates the data librarianship core concepts (motivational factors, challenges, skills and appropriate training platforms) to learn and successfully launch data librarianship services. Design/methodology/approach: A survey method was used and the data were collected through online questionnaire. Purposive sampling method was applied and 132 responses were received with 76 respondents from the public and 56 from the private sector universities of Pakistan. The statistical package for social sciences (SPSS version 25) was used, and descriptive and inferential statistics were applied to analyzed the data. Findings: LIS professionals understand the importance of data-driven library services and perceive that such services are helpful in evolving the image of the library, helping with the establishment of institutional data repositories/data banks, developing data resources and services for library patrons and especially researchers, and receiving appreciation and acknowledgment from the higher authorities. The major challenges that emerged from the data were: missing data policies, limited training opportunities for data librarianship roles, no additional financial benefits, lack of infrastructure and systems, lack of organizational support for the initiation of data-driven services, and lack of skills, knowledge and expertise. Data librarianship is in its early stages in Pakistan, and consequently, the LIS professionals are lacking basic, advanced and technical data-driven skills. Research limitations/implications: The policy, theoretical and practical implications describe an immediate need for framing data policies.

We use an interdisciplinary methodology to test our hypotheses: observing a human-led recruitment panel and building an explainable algorithmic prototype from the ground up, to quantify gender bias. The key findings of this study are threefold: identifying potential sources of human bias from a recruitment panel's ranking of CVs; identifying sources of bias from a potential algorithmic pipeline which simulates human decision making; and recommending ways to mitigate bias from both aspects. Our research has provided an innovative research design that combines social science and data science to theorise how automation may introduce bias in hiring practices, and also pinpoint where it is introduced. It also furthers the current scholarship on gender bias in hiring practices by providing key empirical inferences on the factors contributing to bias.  © 2022 IEEE.",algorithmic bias; CV; gender; recruitment,Employment; Algorithmic bias; Algorithmics; Case-studies; CV; Gender; Gender bias; Hiring practices; Human bias; Potential sources; Recruitment; Decision making,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus

However, because computational social science (CSS) is still relatively new to the social sciences, it can feel like a hidden curriculum for many PhD students. To support social science PhD students, this article is an accessible guide to CSS training based on previous literature and our collective working experiences in academic, public-, and private-sector organizations. We contend that students should supplement their traditional social science training in research design and domain expertise with CSS training by focusing on three core areas: (1) learning data science skills, (2) building a portfolio that uses data science to answer social science questions, and (3) connecting with computational social scientists. We conclude with practical recommendations for departments and professional associations to better support PhD students.  © The Author(s), 2023.

The initiatives exercise ongoing influence on how the capabilities of computational techniques are understood as vehicles of social and political change. This paper analyses the development of the initiatives from a rhetorical slogan into a research program that understands itself as a ‘field’ of applications. It discusses recent academic literature on the topic to show a problematic entanglement between the promotion of initiatives and prescriptions of what ‘good’ ought to be. In contrast, we call researchers to take a practical and analytical step back. The paper provides a framework for future research by calling for descriptive research on the composition of the initiatives and critical research that draws from broader social science debates on computational techniques. The empirical part of the paper provides first steps towards this direction by positioning Data and AI for Good initiatives as part of a single continuum and situating it within a historical trajectory that has its immediate precursor in ICT for Development initiatives. © The Author(s) 2023.",AI for social good; critical data studies; Data for good; data science for social good; ICT for development; technological initiatives,Behavioral research; 'current; AI for social good; Computational technique; Critical data; Critical data study; Data for good; Data science for social good; ICT for development; Stepping back; Technological initiative; Application programs,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus

Causal inference enables the estimation of the impact of an intervention or treatment on the world, making it critical for sound and robust policy making. However, randomized controlled experiments, which are typically considered as the gold standard for inferring causal conclusions, are often not feasible due to ethical, cost, or other constraints. Fortunately, there is a rich literature in Artificial Intelligence (AI), Machine Learning (ML), and Statistics on observational studies, which are methods for causal inference on observed or collected data under certain assumptions. In this paper, we provide an overview of popular formal and rigorous techniques for causal inference on observed data from the AI and Statistics literature. Furthermore, we discuss how concepts from causal inference can be used to infer fairness and enable explainability in machine learning models, which are critical in responsible data science when ML is used in making high-stake decisions in various contexts. Our discussion highlights the importance of using causal inference in ML models and provides insights on how to develop more transparent and responsible AI systems. © 2023, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",,Data Science; Decision making; Causal inferences; Controlled experiment; Fundamental concepts; Gold standards; Machine learning models; Machine-learning; Model-based prediction; Observational study; Policy making; Simple++; Machine learning,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus

Platforms now routinely use algorithmic behaviour modification techniques to manipulate users’ behaviour, leaving academic researchers further isolated in conducting important data science and computational social science research. This isolation results from researchers’ lack of access to human behavioural data and, crucially, to both the data on machine behaviour that triggers and learns from the human data and the platform’s behaviour modification mechanisms.

After all, science and technology are viewpoints diverse by either individual, community, or social. Generally, it depends on socioeconomic capabilities. So it is with computer science has become a phenomenon and fashionable, where based on the stream of documents, various issues arise in either its theory or implementation, adapting different communities, or designing curriculum holds in the education system. Generally, there are gaps between rich and poor, masculine and feminine, and basic sciences, engineering, and social sciences in accessing and using computer science. In particular, there have been various developments in hardware, software, and brain-ware from computer science in the application. There are recurring problems shortly, in the same or different places, both in developed and technologically lagging countries. Although computer science is still new, it has provided various innovations through research, which is proven by many documents. Therefore, following the growth of computer science - documents in the reputable indexed database, Scopus - there are clues for showing the trends. That is, dividing documents into three-time sessions: sloping, increasing and decreasing. That is by using a growth graphic. Then equip it with some parameters: topics and the weights from hit counts of databases. It gives the meaning as an interpretation to support the reviews. Therefore, this paper will provide a commentary related to that growth. It is for showing that despite the spread of studies, at the last time-session, the issues were always present simultaneously at the same time in accumulation. That is for describing a study title of computer science about what the world already has, going, and will understand about computer science. It is a view regarding its philosophy, basic science, applications, and technology as concepts and solutions that make computer science the primary foundation for skills and professions in the 21st century through the education system. Therefore, other scientific fields such as informatics, computer engineering, information science, information technology, and data science, which are at the crossroads of computer science, are also scientific fields that raise different issues. © IJASEIT is licensed under a Creative Commons Attribution-Share Alike 4.0 International License.",Algorithms; Complexity; Information; Learning; Mathematics; Philosophy; Programming; Science; Teaching; Technology,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus

However, modern technologies with adaptive and intelligent features such as smart speakers imitate human social characteristics and appear to be allegedly social interaction partners. Research going beyond the analysis of mere usage and conceptualizing devices as interaction partners is rare, also because studying the establishment of social interactions would require analyses over time. The present paper addresses this research desideratum and introduces a concept of a longitudinal study which involves the collection of different data types from different sources (online questionnaire, providers' log files, interview) and interdisciplinary data analytical methods (social science, data science). Its cross-sectional and longitudinal research questions ask for the adoption and the usage of the usage of smart speakers, for the establishment of social interactions with the device. In sum, this study contributes to the research area by presenting a conceptual research model, which provides a framework for the systematic long-term analysis of both the adoption of technology over time as well as the establishment of potential social interactions.  © 2022 ACM.",adoption of technology; long-term analysis; social interaction; voice-based assistant,Adoption of technology; Conceptual research; Digital assistants; First-time user; Human-human interactions; Long term analysis; Research models; Social interactions; User adoptions; Voice-based assistant; Surveys,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus

They provide recommendation services in various areas, including shopping, eating, travelling and entertainment. RSs have achieved a great success and benefted the society. However, most of the research on RS has focused on the improvement of the recommendation accuracy, while ignoring other important qualities, such as trustworthiness (robustness, fairness, explainability, privacy and security) and social impact (influence on users' recognition and behaviours) of the recommendations. These are important aspects and cannot be overlooked since they measure properties that determine whether the recommendation service is reliable, trustworthy and benefcial to individual users and society.

It covers robust and non-robust descriptive statistics used in each of four bivariate statistical models that are commonly used in research: ANOVA, proportions, regression, and logistic. The text teaches statistical inference principles using resampling methods (such as randomization and bootstrapping), covering methods for hypothesis testing and parameter estimation. These methods are applied to each statistical model introduced in preceding chapters. Data analytic examples are used to teach statistical concepts throughout, and students are introduced to the R packages and functions required for basic data analysis in each of the four models. The text also includes introductory guidance to the fundamentals of data wrangling, as well as examples of write-ups so that students can learn how to communicate findings. Each chapter includes problems for practice or assessment. Supplemental instructional videos are also available as an additional aid to instructors, or as a general resource to students. This book is intended for an introductory or basic statistics course with an applied focus, or an introductory analytics course, at the undergraduate level in a two-year or four-year institution. This can be used for students with a variety of disciplinary backgrounds, from business, to the social sciences, to medicine.

It has been argued that data is as vital a resource as oil was during the industrial revolution. An upward trend in the number of research publications using machine learning in some of the top journals in combination with an increasing number of academic recruiters within psychology asking for Python knowledge from applicants indicates a growing demand for these skills in the market. While there are plenty of books covering data science, rarely, if ever, books in the market address the need of social science students with no computer science background. They are typically written by engineers or computer scientists for people of their discipline. As a result, often such books are filled with technical jargon and examples irrelevant to psychological studies or projects. In contrast, this book was written by a psychologist in a simple, easy-to-understand way that is brief and accessible. The aim for this book was to make the learning experience on this topic as smooth as possible for psychology students/researchers with no background in programming or data science. Completing this book will also open up an enormous amount of possibilities for quantitative researchers in psychological science, as it will enable them to explore newer types of research questions. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2022.",Artificial Intelligence; Behavior; Business Analytics; Deep Learning; Machine Learning; Python; Science,,English,Book,Final,,Scopus

Pundits and critics show different faces (Buch, Engineering, development and philosophy, philosophy of engineering and technology. Springer Science+Business Media, 2012, p. 11). Some construct the problem in terms aligned with business needs. Others, less mundane and from a loftier position, claim that engineers need to be more socially responsible, recognize the contextual complexity of tasks in their designs while seeking to benefit all humankind. Still others see the challenge as keeping up with the emergence of new fields in practice – e.g., data science, artificial intelligence, biology, medicine – and the ever-increasing importance of working across the boundaries of traditional engineering fields to engage with practitioners of science, social science, the arts, and even the liberal arts. This last way of framing the need for renovation in engineering education, stressing the multi-dimensional character of engineering practice, is reflected in a recent study of the National Academies of Science, Engineering, and Medicine – a report documenting innovative educational programs of an integrative nature. The study is titled The Integration of the Humanities and Arts with Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine in Higher Education: Branches from the same Tree and focuses “on better understanding the impact of an integrated educational approach on students.”. In this chapter we: (1) Summarize the report’s results, focusing on the integration of the humanities and the arts with engineering; (2) Critique the report’s implicit vision of what is required for the education of the hybrid, polyvalent engineer; (3) Elaborate on how integrative learning courses and programs might be evaluated; (4) Make an argument for the need for collaboration across disciplines in teaching integrative courses and programs, and additionally consider, what this will demand from faculty. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Engineering education; The humanities and engineering,,English,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus

In the modern era of data science, researchers often have access to response data collected from large-scale surveys or assessments, featuring many items (large J) and many subjects (large N). This is in contrary to the traditional regime with fixed J and large N. To analyze such large-scale data, it is important to develop methods that are both computationally efficient and theoretically valid. In terms of computation, the conventional EM algorithm for latent class models tends to have a slow algorithmic convergence rate for large-scale data and may converge to some local optima instead of the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE). Motivated by this, we introduce the tensor decomposition perspective into latent class analysis with binary responses. Methodologically, we propose to use a moment-based tensor power method in the first step and then use the obtained estimates as initialization for the EM algorithm in the second step. Theoretically, we establish the clustering consistency of the MLE in assigning subjects into latent classes when N and J both go to infinity. Simulation studies suggest that the proposed tensor-EM pipeline enjoys both good accuracy and computational efficiency for large-scale data with binary responses. We also apply the proposed method to an educational assessment dataset as an illustration. © 2022, The Author(s) under exclusive licence to The Psychometric Society.",clustering consistency; EM algorithm; large-scale latent class analysis; tensor decomposition; tensor power method,"Algorithms; Computer Simulation; Humans; Latent Class Analysis; Likelihood Functions; Models, Statistical; Psychometrics; algorithm; computer simulation; human; latent class analysis; psychometry; statistical model",English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus

Most supervised learning methods only work on complete data, thus requiring preprocessing such as missing value imputation to work on incomplete data sets. However, imputation alone does not encode useful information about the missing values themselves. For data sets with informative missing patterns, the Missing Indicator Method (MIM), which adds indicator variables to indicate the missing pattern, can be used in conjunction with imputation to improve model performance. While commonly used in data science, MIM is surprisingly understudied from an empirical and especially theoretical perspective. In this paper, we show empirically and theoretically that MIM improves performance for informative missing values, and we prove that MIM does not hurt linear models asymptotically for uninformative missing values. Additionally, we find that for high-dimensional data sets with many uninformative indicators, MIM can induce model overfitting and thus test performance. To address this issue, we introduce Selective MIM (SMIM), a novel MIM extension that adds missing indicators only for features that have informative missing patterns. We show empirically that SMIM performs at least as well as MIM in general, and improves MIM for high-dimensional data. Lastly, to demonstrate the utility of MIM on real-world data science tasks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of MIM and SMIM on clinical tasks generated from the MIMIC-III database of electronic health records.  © 2023 ACM.",healthcare; imputation; missing values; supervised learning,Clustering algorithms; Health care; Learning systems; Data set; Healthcare; High dimensional data; Higher dimensions; Imputation; Indicator methods; Low-to-high; Missing data; Missing values; Tabular data; Data Science,English,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus

(Science 369:1060–1062, 2020). Our multidisciplinary team of data scientists, statisticians, experts in Artificial Intelligence (AI) and visual analytics had a unique role on the program to investigate accuracy, reproducibility, generalizability, and robustness of the state-of-the-art (SOTA) causal structure learning approaches applied to fully observed and sampled simulated data across virtual worlds. In addition, we analyzed the feasibility of using machine learning models to predict future social behavior with and without causal knowledge explicitly embedded. In this paper, we first present our causal modeling approach to discover the causal structure of four virtual worlds produced by the simulation teams—Urban Life, Financial Governance, Disaster and Geopolitical Conflict. Our approach adapts the state-of-the-art causal discovery (including ensemble models), machine learning, data analytics, and visualization techniques to allow a human-machine team to reverse-engineer the true causal relations from sampled and fully observed data. We next present our reproducibility analysis of two research methods team’s performance using a range of causal discovery models applied to both sampled and fully observed data, and analyze their effectiveness and limitations. We further investigate the generalizability and robustness to sampling of the SOTA causal discovery approaches on additional simulated datasets with known ground truth. Our results reveal the limitations of existing causal modeling approaches when applied to large-scale, noisy, high-dimensional data with unobserved variables and unknown relationships between them. We show that the SOTA causal models explored in our experiments are not designed to take advantage from vasts amounts of data and have difficulty recovering ground truth when latent confounders are present; they do not generalize well across simulation scenarios and are not robust to sampling; they are vulnerable to data and modeling assumptions, and therefore, the results are hard to reproduce. Finally, when we outline lessons learned and provide recommendations to improve models for causal discovery and prediction of human social behavior from observational data, we highlight the importance of learning data to knowledge representations or transformations to improve causal discovery and describe the benefit of causal feature selection for predictive and prescriptive modeling. © 2021, The Author(s).",Causal discovery; Causal structure learning; Data science; Ensemble models; Generalizability; Machine learning; Predictive modeling; Reproducibility; Robustness,Behavioral research; Clustering algorithms; Data Analytics; Data visualization; Learning systems; Machine learning; Predictive analytics; Software testing; Virtual reality; Visualization; Causal discovery; Causal structure learning; Ensemble models; Generalizability; Ground truth; Machine-learning; Predictive models; Reproducibilities; Robustness; State of the art; Knowledge representation,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus

A deep multilayer perceptron and a multiple linear regression implementation are undertaken. The objective is to demonstrate the adequacy of deep learning as a quantitative explanatory paradigm when compared with the classical econometrics approach. The results encompass point predictions, prediction intervals, variable gradients, and the impact of an increase in the class size on grades. Deep learning’s generalization error is lower in the student grade prediction, and its prediction intervals are more accurate. The deep multilayer perceptron gradient empirical distributions largely align with the regression coefficient estimates, indicating a satisfactory regression fit. Based on gradient discrepancies, a student’s mother being an employer does not seem to be a positive factor. A benign paradigm shift concerning the balance between home and career affairs for both genders should be reinforced. The deep multilayer perceptron broadens the spectrum of possibilities, providing a quantum solution hinged on a universal approximator. In the case of an academic achievement-critical factor such as class size, where the literature is neither unanimous on its importance nor its direction, the multilayer perceptron formed three distinct clusters per the individual gradient signals. © 2022 by the authors.

Every year, digital technologies change everyday life, creating the foundations for sustainable socio-economic development. Changes resulting from the revolution in information technology signal the need for new approaches to training, particularly in Ukraine. Technologies are improving at a fairly rapid pace, but the methodological base at the level of Ukrainian high education institutions (HEIs) is adapting to such changes rather slowly, which, accordingly, slows down the process of “smarting” of education. In turn, graduates are not the most attractive for the modern labour market. This article highlights the urgent need for extensive training in this area. In turn, the paper aims to offer a case of the study programme for graduating data science analysts (DSAs). The original approach is the master degree programme case for the social science faculty but not for engineering faculty as it is traditionally. The necessity of DSAs is extremely high in the economic field/business however mostly graduates of the engineering faculties having strong programming skills lack the economic knowledge and understanding of business laws. The contribution of the paper is that the proposed program differs from existing ones on the market, but is not implemented in HEIs, with its systematical adaptability to the requirements of the state standard; as well it meets all the requirements of employers in the field of Data Science. The paper is mostly in the practical and descriptive area thus the methodological base of the research are general scientific research methods like historical method, comparative analysis, methods of analyses & synthesis, system approach and logical generalization. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Data science; Educational program; Entrepreneur university; Skills,Data Science; Economic and social effects; Employment; Engineering education; International trade; Educational program; Engineering faculty; Entrepreneur university; High educations; Higher education institutions; Industrial revolutions; Skill; Technological development; Ukraine; World market; Competition,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus

There is growing interest in assessing the consistency of online reviews and the determinants of learner satisfaction. This study analyses the disconfirmation effect between textual review topics and the determinants of learner satisfaction in MOOCs. The MOOCs are categorised under three disciplines - Social Science, Technical Science, and Humanities & Natural Science. A crawler was employed to collect the corpus, extracting 93,679 reviews of 5,214 online courses from a Chinese university MOOC platform (icourse163.org). Textual analytics was used in the topic extraction. The empirical results suggest a strong disconfirmation effect between textual reviews and the determinants of learner satisfaction, i.e., not all textual review topics affect the overall learner satisfaction. Compared with positive reviews, negative (and neutral) reviews have a stronger disconfirmation effect. Further, the antecedents of learner attention are course-discipline specific.

The data generated by human social networking is also gradually increasing, and big data technology appears in this context. Its main purpose is to obtain key information from complex data sets and realize the role of comprehensive analysis. In recent years, the concept of the Internet of Everything has gradually entered all walks of life. Similar to the design of smart cities, smart communities, and smart buildings, IoT technology has also been adopted. The development of the market economy and the deepening of the reform of the economic system require that the government's public services must also be transformed as soon as possible. The responsibilities undertaken by the government are becoming more and more complex and important. The traditional government public management methods cannot meet the needs of all levels of society. The development of big data and the Internet of Things provides new opportunities for the government to innovate management methods, which is also one of the cores of future government work. The government needs to gradually transform the government's public management method based on big data and the Internet of Things platform, relying on information technology, so as to improve people's satisfaction and happiness index. Based on the problems existing in traditional public management, this paper focuses on the analysis of local government management methods and takes Shenyang City as the case analysis object to innovate local government public management methods and at the same time provides some reference for other regions to innovate public management methods.  © 2022 Wenfang Jin.",,Economics; Internet of Everything; Internet of things; Public administration; Social sciences computing; Complex datasets; Comprehensive analysis; Data technologies; Focus of Attention; Management method; Market economies; Non-Relational Databases; Public management; Smart community; Social-networking; Big data,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus

The QALIPSO project addresses the question of the citizen accompaniment to use connected real-time indoor monitoring systems. A multidisciplinary approach has been pursued providing an in-depth understanding of brakes and levers to foster behaviour changes regarding indoor pollution. Three levels of investigation have been proposed: (i) the metrological assessment of monitoring systems; (ii) the psycho-social analysis of behaviour changes; (iii) the advanced treatment of big data pollution sets. This work confirms the potential of individual monitoring systems to make the citizen aware, induce new practices, and settle durable routines.

This paper’s purposes are twofold: to provide (1) data science an illustration of theory adoption, able to address explanation and support prediction/prescription capacities and (2) a rationale for identification of the key phenomena and properties of data science so that the data speak through a contextual understanding of reality, broader than has been usual. Design/methodology/approach: A literature review and a derived conceptual research model for a push–pull approach (adapted for a data science study in the management field) are presented. A real location–allocation problem is solved through a specific algorithm and explained in the light of the adapted push–pull theory, serving as an instance for a data science theory-informed application in the management field. Findings: This study advances knowledge on the definition of data science key phenomena as not just pure “data”, but interrelated data and datasets properties, as well as on the specific adaptation of the push-pull theory through its definition, dimensionality and interaction model, also illustrating how to apply the theory in a data science theory-informed research. The proposed model contributes to the theoretical strengthening of data science, still an incipient area, and the solution of the location-allocation problem suggests the applicability of the proposed approach to broad data science problems, alleviating the criticism on the lack of explanation and the focus on pattern recognition in data science practice and research. Research limitations/implications: The proposed algorithm requires the previous definition of a perimeter of interest. This aspect should be characterised as an antecedent to the model, which is a strong assumption. As for prescription, in this specific case, one has to take complementary actions, since theory, model and algorithm are not detached from in loco visits, market research or interviews with potential stakeholders. Practical implications: This study offers a conceptual model for practical location–allocation problem analyses, based on the push–pull theoretical components. So, it suggests a proper definition for each component (the object, the perspective, the forces, its degrees and the nature of the movement). The proposed model has also an algorithm for computational implementation, which visually describes and explains components interaction, allowing further simulation (estimated forces degrees) for prediction. Originality/value: First, this study identifies an overlap of push–pull theoretical approaches, which suggests theory adoption eventually as mere common sense, weakening further theoretical development. Second, this study elaborates a definition for the push–pull theory, a dimensionality and a relationship between its components. Third, a typical location–allocation problem is analysed in the light of the refactored theory, showing its adequacy for that class of problems. And fourth, this study suggests that the essence of a data science should be the study of contextual relationships among data, and that the context should be provided by the spatial, temporal, political, economic and social analytical interests. © 2021, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Data science; Interdisciplinarity; Location–allocation problem; Management; Push–pull theory,Computation theory; Location; Pattern recognition; Components interaction; Computational implementations; Contextual relationships; Contextual understanding; Design/methodology/approach; Location allocation problem; Phenomena and properties; Theoretical development; Data Science,English,Article,Final,,Scopus

We outline a community-driven approach to identify pressing resiliency issues and deploy dashboard tools on targeted areas for significant community benefit. Our research builds on the offerings of data science to aid community-focused decision support systems to enable evidence-based and real-time decision-making. We hypothesize that building community resilience in response to emerging challenges requires a combination of timely data at the local scale and easy-to-use decision support tools. This research particularly focuses on augmenting the capacity of communities through dashboard technologies to comprehend rapidly evolving issues and address them in a timely and efficient manner. Our work contributes to a rapidly growing research domain around geospatial data visualization technologies that are increasingly playing a vital role in the shaping of government policies, including resiliency planning and disaster response. This study argues that dashboards that are action-oriented, easy-to-use, and locally embedded within the community have much more potential to be used as a decision-support system. The findings indicate that community-based knowledge networks catalyzed and influenced by modern technologies might provide a model to negotiate the gaps between ecosystem-based and social-science-focused conceptualization of community resilience.  © 2022 International Society for Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing.

From more than a decade, the expert finding problem attracted much attention in information retrieval research. Based on the encountered gaps in the expert identification across several Q & A portals, we inspect the feasibility of identifying data science experts in Reddit. Our method is based on the manual coding results where two data science experts labelled not only expert and non-expert comments, but also out-of-scope comments, which is a novel contribution to the literature, enabling the identification of more groups of comments across web portals. We present a semi-supervised approach which combines 1113 labelled comments with 100,226 unlabelled comments during training. We proved that it is possible to develop models that can identify expert, non-expert and out-of-scope comments peaking the AUC score at 0.93, accuracy at 0.83, MAE at 0.15 degrees and R2 score at 0.69. The proposed model uses the activity behaviour of every user, including Natural Language Processing (NLP), crowdsourced and user feature sets. We conclude that the NLP and user feature sets contribute the most to the better identification of these three classes. It means that this method can generalise well within the domain. Finally, we make a novel contribution by presenting different types of users in Reddit, which opens many future research directions. © 2023, The Author(s).",Computational social science; Data mining; Data-driven evaluation; Reddit; User expertise,Behavioral research; Data Science; Natural language processing systems; Portals; Computational approach; Computational social science; Data driven; Data-driven evaluation; Features sets; Language processing; Natural languages; Reddit; User expertise; User feature; Data mining,English,Article,Article in press,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus

The main technical solutions for guaranteeing a user's privacy are encryption, pseudonymization, anonymization, differential privacy (DP), and obfuscation. Despite the success of other solutions, anonymization has been widely used in commercial settings for privacy preservation because of its algorithmic simplicity and low computing overhead. It facilitates unconstrained analysis of published data that DP and the other latest techniques cannot offer, and it is a mainstream solution for responsible data science. In this paper, we present a comprehensive analysis of clustering-based anonymization mechanisms (CAMs) that have been recently proposed to preserve both privacy and utility in data publishing. We systematically categorize the existing CAMs based on heterogeneous types of data (tables, graphs, matrixes, etc.), and we present an up-to-date, extensive review of existing CAMs and the metrics used for their evaluation. We discuss the superiority and effectiveness of CAMs over traditional anonymization mechanisms. We highlight the significance of CAMs in different computing paradigms, such as social networks, the internet of things, cloud computing, AI, and location-based systems with regard to privacy preservation. Furthermore, we present various proposed representative CAMs that compromise individual privacy, rather than safeguarding it. Besides, this article provides an extended knowledge (e.g., key assertion(s), strengths, weaknesses, clustering methods used in the anonymization process, and %age improvements in quantitative results) about each technique that provides a clear view of how much this topic has been investigated thus far, and what are the research gaps that seek pertinent solutions in the near future. Finally, we discuss the technical challenges of applying CAMs, and we suggest promising opportunities for future research. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work to systematically cover current CAMs involving different data types and computing paradigms.  © 2013 IEEE.",anonymization; artificial intelligence; clustering; de-anonymization; differential privacy; encryption; personal data; Privacy; pseudonymization; responsible data science; social networks; utility,Cams; Cryptography; Distributed computer systems; Publishing; Social networking (online); Social sciences computing; Anonymization; Clusterings; De-anonymization; Differential privacies; Privacy; Pseudonymization; Social network; Social networking (online); Utility; Data privacy,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus

However, from Monopoly to Flight Simulators, serious games have also been appealing tools for learning a new language, conveying values, or training skills. The resurgence of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and data science in the last decade presents a unique window of opportunity for its integration into video games. This integration is of particular interest due to the vast amount of data that can be collected through a game, which is needed to feed the AI algorithms. This paper aims to identify relevant research paths in the intersection of serious games, AI, and computational social science, particularly in their utilization as novel research tools to comprehend human behavior and society. To provide a comprehensive context, we also present an overview of the serious game research field identifying the most prominent application areas and analyzing applications of AI in serious games that hold great potential for computational social science research. The goal of our work is to establish a valuable framework for researchers interested in utilizing serious games as a novel tool for AI-supported social research.  © 2013 IEEE.",artificial intelligence; computational social science; human behaviour; novel research tools; Serious games,Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; Flight simulators; Human computer interaction; Personnel training; Virtual reality; Behavioral science; Computational modelling; Computational social science; Game; Human behaviors; Novel research tool; Recruitment; Research tools; Training skills; Video-games; Serious games,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus

By presenting here in greater detail research design and pilot results of a project using professional networking data to understand the careers of IT industry analysts, I suggest a view on the collaboration between data science and social science as coordinated labour. The application of participative epistemology to social data science is articulated in three points: (1) a more tactical view on the partnerships with commercial data where shared value system is not a pre-requisite for coordinated knowledge production; (2) an appreciation for complementarities in perspective between phenomenological sociology, expertise in computer science associated to digitalisation and the narrative positivism linked with the use of statistics and (3) a view on social data science as contributing empirical sociology with new sensitizing concepts, taking ethnography to reflectively address its own presuppositions. © 2021 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Ethnography; Interdisciplinarity; Social Data Science; Sociology of Professions,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus

It merges various domains such as history, philosophy, literature, and modern languages, offering unique approaches to traditional inquiries. DH has gained considerable popularity among students, academicians, and Library and Information Science (LIS) professionals, creating new employment opportunities in libraries, museums, archives, cultural heritage organisations, data science, and other sectors. In India, DH is still in its early stages, with diverse manifestations in university-level teaching and learning practices. This study examines the DH components integrated into the LIS course curriculum by analysing syllabi and course descriptions from central universities. Additionally, we briefly review DH research projects and programs in India and abroad. To enhance the design and implementation of DH programs and degrees alongside LIS curricula, a course module for DH within LIS schools is proposed. This research extends insights into DH pedagogical practices within librarianship education, offering a comprehensive perspective on contextual frameworks, academic discussions, development trends in DH, and the LIS field in India. © 2023, DESIDOC.",Curriculum; Digital humanities; Digital pedagogy; Latent dirichlet allocation; Library and information science,,English,Article,Final,,Scopus

Although reactive predator detection methods have been studied, proactive victim protection and crime prevention can also be achieved through vulnerability analysis of potential youth victims. Despite its significance, vulnerability analysis has not been thoroughly studied in the data science literature, while several social science studies used survey-based methods. To address this gap, we investigate humans' social-psychological traits and quantify key vulnerability factors to cybergrooming by analyzing text features in the Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count (LIWC). Through pairwise correlation studies, we demonstrate the degrees of key vulnerability dimensions to cybergrooming from youths' conversational features. Our findings reveal that victims have negative correlations with family and community traits, contrasting with previous social survey studies that indicated family relationships or social support as key vulnerability factors. We discuss the current limitations of text mining analysis and suggest cross-validation methods to increase the validity of research findings. Overall, this study provides valuable insights into understanding the vulnerability factors to cybergrooming and highlights the importance of adopting multidisciplinary approaches.  © 2023 Owner/Author.",and vulnerability.; cybergrooming; Natural language processing; online social deception; social-psychological analysis; text mining,Cybersecurity; Data mining; Social networking (online); And vulnerability.; Cybergrooming; Language processing; Natural language processing; Natural languages; Online social deception; Psychological analysis; Social-psychological analyse; Text-mining; Vulnerability analysis; Natural language processing systems,English,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus

However, despite nearly three decades of developing GM crops for explicit use on the African continent, very little is known about this research, and very few crop varieties have moved from development to use by farmers. This paper introduces a collection of three multi-modal datasets to provide insight into the social, political, and economic actors shaping the future of GM crop development in Africa. Our interdisciplinary team compiled a dataset of GM crops in the research development pipeline, a collection of financial disclosures of funders supporting GM crop research, and a collection of over 2 million articles on agriculture and GM crop reporting from African media. We demonstrate the effectiveness of combining these pertinent datasets to aid in social science analysis of the social, political, and economic landscape of agricultural biotechnology in Africa. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Africa; Agriculture; Data science; Genetically modified crops; Genetically modified organisms; International development; Multi-modal data,Climate change; Food supply; Modal analysis; Sustainable development; Africa; Crop development; Environmental sustainability; Food security; Genetically modified crops; Genetically modified organisms; Interdisciplinary teams; International development; Multi-modal data; Multi-modal dataset; Crops,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus

Data science draws from methodology developed in such fields as applied mathematics, statistics, machine learning, data mining, data management, visualization, and HCI. It drives discoveries in business, economy, biology, medicine, environmental science, the physical sciences, the humanities and social sciences, and beyond. Machine learning and data mining and visualization are integral parts of data science, and essential to enable sophisticated analysis of data. Nevertheless, both research areas are currently still rather separated and investigated by different communities rather independently.

Here, we describe the experience and lessons learned from a joint project with the WHO Regional Office for Africa (WHO AFRO) to support the sub-Saharan African COVID-19 response. In June 2020, WHO AFRO contracted a number of consultants to reinforce the COVID-19 response in member states by providing actionable epidemiological analysis. Given the urgency of the situation and the magnitude of work required, we recruited a worldwide network of field experts, academics and students in the areas of public health, data science and social science to support the effort. Most analyses were performed on a merged line list of COVID-19 cases using a reverse engineering model (line listing built using data extracted from national situation reports shared by countries with the Regional Office for Africa as per the IHR (2005) obligations). The data analysis platform The Renku Project (https://renkulab.io) provided secure data storage and permitted collaborative coding. Over a period of 6 months, 63 contributors from 32 nations (including 17 African countries) participated in the project. A total of 45 in-depth country-specific epidemiological reports and data quality reports were prepared for 28 countries. Spatial transmission and mortality risk indices were developed for 23 countries. Text and video-based training modules were developed to integrate and mentor new members. The team also began to develop EpiGraph Hub, a web application that automates the generation of reports similar to those we created, and includes more advanced data analyses features (e.g. mathematical models, geospatial analyses) to deliver real-time, actionable results to decision-makers. Within a short period, we implemented a global collaborative approach to health data management and analyses to advance national responses to health emergencies and outbreaks. The interdisciplinary team, the hands-on training and mentoring, and the participation of local researchers were key to the success of this initiative. © 2022, The Author(s).",COVID-19; Data management; Health emergency; Outbreak; Pandemic; Sub-Saharan Africa,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus

It involves the skillful implementation of a multitude of data analysis and interpretation methods to reach managerial and operational decisions. For this reason, it poses a number of challenges to students in all disciplines, especially in the social sciences. The present study highlights these challenges through the analysis of 4 complementary research works that are based on 3 instruments: a scientific corpus, surveys, and data science job offers posted on LinkedIn-Israel. The study’s findings indicate that although data science is perceived to be an important domain that exerts a high influence on our society, social sciences’ students still do not have sufficient skills to cope with the challenges it poses. The study suggests equipping students with the skills and qualifications necessary for big data analysis through the design of adequate academic programs. The current article discusses these findings and their implications. © 2022 International Association for Computer Information Systems.",Big data; data analysis; data science; quantitative skills; social science skills,Behavioral research; Data handling; Data Science; Students; Academic program; Complex domains; Data analysis-methods; Data challenges; Interpretation methods; LinkedIn; Managerial decision; Operational decisions; Quantitative skill; Social science skill; Big data,English,Article,Final,,Scopus

We designed an experimental game that emulated worker decision-making in a swine facility during an outbreak. In order to combat contamination, the simulation features a line-of-separation biosecurity protocol. Participants are provided disease severity information and can choose whether or not to comply with a shower protocol. Each simulated decision carried the potential for either an economic cost or an opportunity cost, both of which affected their potential real-world earnings. Participants must weigh the risk infection vs. an opportunity cost associated with compliance. Participants then completed a multiple price list (MPL) risk assessment survey. The survey uses a context-free, paired-lottery approach in which one of two options may be selected, with varying probabilities of a high and low risk payouts. We compared game response data to MPL risk assessment. Game risk was calculated using the normalized frequency of biosecurity compliance. Three predominant strategies were identified: risk averse participants who had the highest rate of compliance; risk tolerant participants who had the lowest compliance rate; and opportunists who adapted their strategy depending on disease risk. These findings were compared to the proportion of risk averse choices observed within the MPL and were classified into 3 categories: risk averse, risk tolerant and neutral. We found weak positive correlation between risk measured in our experimental game compared to the MPL. However, risk averse classified participants in the MPL tended to comply with the biosecurity protocol more often than those classified as risk tolerant. We also found that the behavioral risk clusters and categorization via the MPL were significantly, yet weakly associated. Overall, behavioral distributions were skewed toward more risk averse choices in both the MPL and game. However, the MPL risk assessment wasn't a strong predictor for observed game behavior. This may indicate that MPL risk aversion metrics might not be sufficient to capture these simulated, situational risk aversion behaviors. Experimental games have a large potential for expanding upon traditional survey instruments by immersing participants in a complex decision mechanism, and capturing dynamic and evolving behavioral signals.

For researchers to approach police departments without first considering the concerns held by officers and their departments at large, is unethical, unproductive, and undermines efforts to secure longstanding mutually useful researcher-practitioner partnerships. In presenting a case study analysis of the multi-method National Justice Database’s recruitment practices, this chapter highlights some of the challenges that emerge when articulating study aims that hold relevance for public safety; defining theoretically- and solution-oriented research questions; administrative police data collection, analysis, and dissemination; and bolstering human research subject protection protocols for sworn officers who may be justifiably reluctant to participate in social science research endeavors. Implications for ethical policing research practice, fostering collaborative researcher-practitioner partnerships, and leveraging the benefits of data science are also discussed. © 2022 selection and editorial matter, David Weisburd.",,,English,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus

Interdisciplinary programs, in which computer science is combined with other domains, range from bioinformatics to computational linguistics and data science. Data science is an interdisciplinary field that integrates computer science, mathematics, statistics, and the domain knowledge of the data involved. It is a relevant research skill for many disciplines, including social sciences. Specifically, graduate psychology students who wish to learn data science have already mastered the psychology domain knowledge and their statistics background is advanced. They lack, however, the computer science knowledge required for meaningfully handling data science. The problem is, however, that there is no CS1 course that fits graduate psychology students who study data science: On the one hand, the current CS1 courses do not suit social science students; on the other hand, CS1 courses for non-majors usually do not meet the required level of computer science needed for data science. Accordingly, to close this gap, we designed a new CS1 course - an interdisciplinary Introduction to Computer Science for Psychological Science course - that a) suits social science students and b) meets the required computer science level for data science. We evaluated the course by examining students' learning outcomes, reflections, and responses on questionnaires. Based on the data analysis according to the self-determination motivation theory, it is concluded that the course design enabled to achieve the course's targets. © 2022 IEEE.",computer science education; CS1 course; Data science; graduate psychology students; interdisciplinary; machine learning,Behavioral research; Curricula; Data handling; Data Science; Domain Knowledge; Education computing; Machine learning; Surveys; Computer Science Education; CS1 course; Domain knowledge; Graduate psychology student; Interdisciplinary; Interdisciplinary education; Interdisciplinary fields; Interdisciplinary programs; Multiple domains; Non-majors; Students,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus

These overarching humanitarian challenges disproportionately impact historically marginalized communities worldwide. UN OCHA estimates that 274 million people will need humanitarian support in 2022. Despite growing perils to human and environmental well-being, there remains a paucity of publicly-engaged computing research to inform the design of interventions. Data science efforts exist, but they remain isolated from socioeconomic, environmental, cultural, and policy contexts at local and international scales. Moreover, biases and privacy infringements in data-driven methods further amplify existing inequalities. The result is that proclaimed benefits of data-driven innovations may remain inaccessible to policymakers, practitioners, and underserved communities whose lives they intend to transform. To address gaps in knowledge and improve the livelihood of marginalized populations, we have established the Data-driven Humanitarian Mapping and Policymaking, an interdisciplinary initiative.  © 2022 Owner/Author.",algorithmic decision-making and ethics; climate crisis; community-based design; computational social science; data science and public policy; data-driven humanitarian action; fair and interpretable machine learning; human-centered data science; public policy; remote sensing.; social computing; sustainable development,Behavioral research; Climate change; Machine learning; Mapping; Population statistics; Public policy; Remote sensing; Sustainable development; Algorithmic decision-making and ethic; Algorithmics; Climate crisis; Community-based; Community-based design; Computational social science; Data driven; Data science and public policy; Data-driven humanitarian action; Decisions makings; Fair and interpretable machine learning; Human-centered data science; Machine-learning; Remote sensing.; Remote-sensing; Science and public policy; Social computing; Decision making,English,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus

However, the quantity of historical weather observations to be rescued globally far exceeds the resources available to do the rescuing. Which observations should be prioritized? Here we formalize guidelines help make decisions on rescuing historical data. Rather than wait until resource-intensive digitization is done to assess the data’s value, insights can be gleaned from the context in which the observations were made and the history of the ob-servers. Further insights can be gained from the transcription platforms used and the transcribers involved in the data rescue process, without which even the best historical observations can be mishandled. We use the concept of trust to help integrate and formalize the guidelines across the life cycle of data rescue, from the original observation source to the transcribed data element. Five cases of citizen science-based historical data rescue, two from Canada and three from Australia, guide us in constructing a trust checklist. The checklist assembles information from the original observers and their observations to the current transcribers and transcription approaches they use. Nineteen elements are generated to help future data rescue projects answer the question of whether resources should be devoted to rescuing historical meteorological material under consideration. © 2022 American Meteorological Society.",Atmosphere; Australia; Climate records; Data science; Decision-making; North America; Social Science; Software,Australia; Canada; climate change; data set; decision making; software,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus

With the development of technology, the sample sizes and dimensions of digital news data increase remarkably. To alleviate the computational burden in big data, this paper proposes a method to deal with massive and moderate-dimensional data for linear regression models via combing model averaging and subsampling methodologies. The author first samples a subsample from the full data according to some special probabilities and split covariates into several groups to construct candidate models. Then, the author solves each candidate model and calculates the model-averaging weights to combine these estimators based on this subsample. Additionally, the asymptotic optimality in subsampling form is proved and the way to calculate optimal subsampling probabilities is provided. The author also illustrates the proposed method via simulations, which shows it takes less running time than that of the full data and generates more accurate estimations than uniform subsampling. Finally, the author applies the proposed method to analyze and predict the sharing number of news, and finds the topic, vocabulary and dissemination time are the determinants. © 2023, The Editorial Office of JSSC & Springer-Verlag GmbH Germany.",Asymptotic optimality; dissemination of news; linear regression models; model averaging; optimal subsampling,Data Science; Regression analysis; AND splits; Asymptotic optimality; Candidate models; Computational burden; Digital news; Dissemination of news; Linear regression modelling; Model averaging; Optimal subsampling; Sample sizes; Social sciences computing,English,Article,Article in press,,Scopus

Up to now, CSS studies have mostly developed on a small, proof-of concept, scale that prevented from unleashing its potential to provide systematic impact to the policy cycle, as well as from improving the understanding of societal problems to the definition, assessment, evaluation, and monitoring of policies. The aim of this handbook is to fill this gap by exploring ways to analyse and model data for policy support, and to advocate the adoption of CSS solutions for policy by raising awareness of existing implementations of CSS in policy-relevant fields. To this end, the book explores applications of computational methods and approaches like big data, machine learning, statistical learning, sentiment analysis, text mining, systems modelling, and network analysis to different problems in the social sciences. The book is structured into three Parts: the first chapters on foundational issues open with an exposition and description of key policymaking areas where CSS can provide insights and information. In detail, the chapters cover public policy, governance, data justice and other ethical issues. Part two consists of chapters on methodological aspects dealing with issues such as the modelling of complexity, natural language processing, validity and lack of data, and innovation in official statistics. Finally, Part three describes the application of computational methods, challenges and opportunities in various social science areas, including economics, sociology, demography, migration, climate change, epidemiology, geography, and disaster management. The target audience of the book spans from the scientific community engaged in CSS research to policymakers interested in evidence-informed policy interventions, but also includes private companies holding data that can be used to study social sciences and are interested in achieving a policy impact. © The Rightsholder (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2023.",Big Data Analytics; Computational Social Science; Data Science; Machine Learning; Natural Language Processing; Open Access; Sentiment Analysis; Statistical Learning,,English,Book,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus

It is critical to data-intensive science because it makes complex data pipelines possible, studies reproducible, and data reusable. Yet the complexities of the hands-on, technical, and intellectual work of data curation is frequently overlooked or downplayed. Obscuring the work of data curation not only renders the labor and contributions of data curators invisible but also hides the impact that curators' work has on the later usability, reliability, and reproducibility of data. To better understand the work and impact of data curation, we conducted a close examination of data curation at a large social science data repository, the Inter-university Consortium for Political and Social Research (ICPSR). We asked: What does curatorial work entail at ICPSR, and what work is more or less visible to different stakeholders and in different contexts? And, how is that curatorial work coordinated across the organization? We triangulated accounts of data curation from interviews and records of curation in Jira tickets to develop a rich and detailed account of curatorial work. While we identified numerous curatorial actions performed by ICPSR curators, we also found that curators rely on a number of craft practices to perform their jobs. The reality of their work practices defies the rote sequence of events implied by many life cycle or workflow models. Further, we show that craft practices are needed to enact data curation best practices and standards.

School dropout is a culmination of various factors that drive children to leave school, and timely policy responses are most needed to address these underlying factors and improve school retention of children over time. However, applying ML approaches to school dropout prediction is an important challenge, especially in low-income countries, where data collection and management systems are relatively more prone to financial and technical constraints. For this reason, this study suggests using already collected household panel data to predict the probability of school dropout and explore feature importance for primary school children in Malawi through ML models. A rich set of variables is obtained in this study from the household data and used to build Random Forest (RF), least absolute shrinkage and selection operator (LASSO), Ridge and multilayer neural network (MNN) models. The study further explores how performance metrics differ when we embed the training samples' weights representing frequency in sampling design into the cost function of these ML models to discuss the implications of using household data in computational social science. LASSO and MNN models trained with sample weights become more prominent due to their higher recall rates of 80.6% and 78.8%. Compared to the baseline model trained with sample weights, the recall rate gained is roughly 56 percentage points using LASSO and 54 percentage points using MNN. Also, comparing LASSO and MNN trained with and without sample weights reveals that training models with sample weights increase the recall rate roughly by 11 percentage points for LASSO and 12 percentage points for MNN. Lastly, the paper provides a comprehensive and unified approach to better interpret the models using a game-theoretic approach – SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) – to quantify feature importance. As a result, socio-economic characteristics of children, such as working in household farming and father's education level, are among the most important features contributing to the probability of school dropout in ML models. This study argues that the weighted sample structure of household data and its wide range of variables explored through the SHAP method for feature importance can enrich the literature and yield valuable results to harness data science for society. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Educational data mining; Feature importance; Machine learning; Sample weights; School dropout prediction,,English,Article,Final,,Scopus

EPA’s Office of Research and Development (ORD) provides the scientific bases for regulatory and public health policies that have broad impacts on the nation’s natural resources and quality of human life and that yield economic benefits and incur compliance costs for the regulated community. In addition, ORD develops the agency’s core research capabilities, providing tools and methods that can be applied to address complex environmental challenges. ORD research aids in the development of responses to emerging threats, provides scientific methods for ecological and human health risk assessment, and serves as a national and international resource for the advancement of environmental science. Those activities require the integration of scientific evidence across many disciplines including biology, chemistry, ecology, engineering, toxicology, air quality, water quality, exposure science, social science, and environmental health. Meeting the agency’s research needs is complicated by EPA’s regulatory role in often controversial policy decisions and challenged by ORD’s steadily declining budgets and workforce capacity. As a part of fulfilling its role, ORD conducts innovative and forward-looking research that improves EPA’s capability of addressing emerging, complex environmental problems. It pursues that endeavor while meeting the need for reactive, problem-driven research to support EPA’s implementation of statutory requirements and other decision-making. ORD recognizes that continued accomplishment of EPA’s mission requires research that anticipates the most challenging problems, develops and adapts emerging scientific tools, and identifies and implements innovative solutions. In that light, ORD asked the National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine to form a committee to identify emerging scientific and technological advances from across a broad range of disciplines, such as environmental monitoring and data science, that ORD should consider in its research planning to support EPA’s mission, provide advice on how ORD might strategically position its research and development enterprise to anticipate and respond to the future research needs of the agency, and consider advances that help EPA better incorporate systems thinking into interdisciplinary approaches. © 2023 by the National Academy of Sciences.",,,English,Book,Final,,Scopus

Research has largely used data-driven modeling to detect patterns in people’s movements, but such approaches are often devoid of psychological theory and fail to capitalize on what movement data can convey about associated thoughts, feelings, attitudes, and behavior. This article outlines trends in current research in this area and discusses how psychologists can better address theoretical and methodological challenges in future work while capitalizing on the opportunities that digital movement data present. We argue that combining approaches from psychology and data science will improve researchers’ and policy makers’ abilities to make predictions about individuals’ or groups’ movement patterns.

Thus, providing renewed momentum to the relatively new research area of eXplainable AI (XAI). Nowadays, the importance of XAI lies in the fact that the increasing control transference to this kind of system for decision making -or, at least, its use for assisting executive stakeholders- already affects many sensitive realms (as in Politics, Social Sciences, or Law). The decision-making power handover to opaque AI systems makes mandatory explaining those, primarily in application scenarios where the stakeholders are unaware of both the high technology applied and the basic principles governing the technological solutions. The issue should not be reduced to a merely technical problem; the explainer would be compelled to transmit richer knowledge about the system (including its role within the informational ecosystem where he/she works). To achieve such an aim, the explainer could exploit, if necessary, practices from other scientific and humanistic areas. The first aim of the paper is to emphasize and justify the need for a multidisciplinary approach that is beneficiated from part of the scientific and philosophical corpus on Explaining, underscoring the particular nuances of the issue within the field of Data Science. The second objective is to develop some arguments justifying the authors’ bet by a more relevant role of ideas inspired by, on the one hand, formal techniques from Knowledge Representation and Reasoning, and on the other hand, the modeling of human reasoning when facing the explanation. This way, explaining modeling practices would seek a sound balance between the pure technical justification and the explainer-explainee agreement. © 2022, The Author(s).",Bounded rationality; Complex systems; Data science; Explainable Artificial Intelligence; Symbolic Artificial Intelligence,Behavioral research; Data Science; Knowledge representation; Philosophical aspects; AI systems; Bounded rationality; Decisions makings; Explainable artificial intelligence; Hand over; Power; Research areas; Social law; Sociotechnical; Symbolic artificial intelligence; Decision making,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus

These can usually be obtained by the biometrical sensors embedded in smart devices. The currently used data collecting approach, where data ownership and property rights are taken by the data scientists, designers of a device or a related application, delivers multiple ethical, sociological and governance concerns. In this paper, the author is opening a systemic examination of a data sharing concept in which data producers execute their data property rights. Design/methodology/approach: Since data sharing concept delivers a substantially different alternative, it needs to be thoroughly examined from multiple perspectives, among them: the ethical, social and feasibility. At this stage, theoretical examination modes in the form of literature analysis and mental model development are being performed. Findings: Data sharing concepts, framework, mechanisms and swift viability are examined. The author determined that data sharing could lead to virtuous data science by augmenting data producers' capacity to govern their data and regulators' capacity to interact in the process. Truly interdisciplinary research is proposed to follow up on this research. Research limitations/implications: Since the research proposal is theoretical, the proposal may not provide direct applicative value but is largely focussed on fuelling the research directions. Practical implications: For the researchers, data sharing concepts will provide an alternative approach and help resolve multiple ethical considerations related to the internet of things (IoT) data collecting approach. For the practitioners in data science, it will provide numerous new challenges, such as distributed data storing, distributed data analysis and intelligent data sharing protocols. Social implications: Data sharing may post significant implications in research and development. Since ethical, legislative moral and trust-related issues are managed in the negotiation process, data can be shared freely, which in a practical sense expands the data pool for virtuous research in social sciences. Originality/value: The paper opens new research directions of data sharing concepts and space for a new field of research. © 2022, Igor Perko.",Artificial intelligence; Cybernetics; Data sharing; Hybrid reality; Systems thinking,Artificial intelligence; Ethical technology; Internet of things; Systems thinking; Data collecting; Data producers; Data properties; Data Sharing; High quality; Hybrid reality; Model diagnosis; Property right; System thinkings; Viable systems modelling (VSM); Data acquisition,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus

The current study investigates whether users assign different roles to devices and how this affects their usage behavior, user experience, and social perceptions. Since social roles take time to establish, we equipped 106 participants with Alexa or Google assistants and some smart home devices and observed their interactions for nine months. We analyzed diverse subjective (questionnaire) and objective data (interaction data). By combining social science and data science analyses, we identified two distinct clusters—users who assigned a friendship role to IVAs over time and users who did not. Interestingly, these clusters exhibited significant differences in their usage behavior, user experience, and social perceptions of the devices. For example, participants who assigned a role to IVAs attributed more friendship to them used them more frequently, reported more enjoyment during interactions, and perceived more empathy for IVAs.

The field of learning analytics (LA) has emerged over the last decade at the intersection of data science, learning sciences, human-centered and instructional design, and organizational change, and so could in principle inform how data can be gathered and analyzed in ways that support professional learning. However, in contrast to formal education where most research in LA has been conducted, much work-integrated learning is experiential, social, situated, and practice-bound. Supporting such learning exposes a significant weakness in LA research, and to make sense of this gap, this article proposes an adaptation of the Knowledge-Agency Window framework. It draws attention to how different forms of professional learning locate on the dimensions of learner agency and knowledge creation. Specifically, we argue that the concept of 'reframing oneself' holds particular relevance for informal, work-integrated learning. To illustrate how this insight translates into LA design for professionals, three examples are provided: first, analyzing personal and team skills profiles (skills analytics); second, making sense of challenging workplace experiences (reflective writing analytics); and third, reflecting on orientation to learning (dispositional analytics). We foreground professional agency as a key requirement for such techniques to be used effectively and ethically.  © 2008-2011 IEEE.",dispositional analytics; learning analytics (LA); professional learning; reflection; self-assessmentÂ technologies; skills analytics; writing analytics; Â Agency,E-learning; Engineering education; Professional aspects; Social networking (online); Social sciences computing; Agency; Dispositional analytic; Learning analytic; Professional learning; Self-assessment; Self-assessment technology; Skill analytic; Social networking (online); Stakeholder; Technological innovation; Writing; Writing analytic; Personnel training,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus

Although many examples exist for using critical and computational thinking in STEM educational area, the social sciences i.e., non-STEM areas were somehow left out due to the relatively more difficult design of such content, especially in the part of the development of computational thinking. In that context, in this paper we present one way of using critical and computational thinking in non-STEM education, more specifically on the example of historical data sources, through the use of programming in Python. As an example, we use historical data for Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade routes, that were the largest long-distance coerced movement of people in history up to the mid-nineteenth century, for connecting concepts of databases, Data Science and programming for development of critical and computational thinking in context of history science. This way of using modern approaches in classroom should give teachers and pupils a broader picture of importance of interdisciplinary education for critical and computational thinking development through STEM and non-STEM classes that give pupils novel skills needed for future labor market. © 2023 MIPRO Croatian Society.","Computational Thinking; Critical Thinking; Data Science; history, Trans-Atlantic Slave Trade routes; programming; Python; STEM, non-STEM","Commerce; Data Science; High level languages; Microelectronics; Computational thinkings; Critical thinking; Data application; Data set; Historical data; History, trans-atlantic slave trade route; Primary and secondary education; Programming; STEM, non-STEM; Trade routes; Python",English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus

Data science, data management, and data mining are all critical components for various types of organizations, including large and small corporations, academic institutions, and government entities. For companies, these components serve to extract insights and value from their data, empowering them to make evidence-driven decisions and gain a competitive advantage by discovering patterns and trends and avoiding costly mistakes. Academic institutions utilize these tools to analyze large datasets and gain insights into various scientific fields of study, including genetic data, climate data, financial data, and in the social sciences they are used to analyze survey data, behavioral data, and public opinion data. Governments use data science to analyze data that can inform policy decisions, such as identifying areas with high crime rates, determining which regions need infrastructure development, and predicting disease outbreaks. However, individuals who are not data science experts, but are experts within their own fields, may need to apply their experience to the data they must manage, but still struggle to expand their knowledge of how to use data mining tools such as RapidMiner software. Principles and Theories of Data Mining With RapidMiner is a comprehensive guide for students and individuals interested in experimenting with data mining using RapidMiner software. This book takes a practical approach to learning through the RapidMiner tool, with exercises and case studies that demonstrate how to apply data mining techniques to real-world scenarios. Readers will learn essential concepts related to data mining, such as supervised learning, unsupervised learning, association rule mining, categorical data, continuous data, and data quality. Additionally, readers will learn how to apply data mining techniques to popular algorithms, including k-nearest neighbor (K-NN), decision tree, naïve bayes, artificial neural network (ANN), k-means clustering, and probabilistic methods. By the end of the book, readers will have the skills and confidence to use RapidMiner software effectively and efficiently, making it an ideal resource for anyone, whether a student or a professional, who needs to expand their knowledge of data mining with RapidMiner software. © 2023 by IGI Global.

While (critical) research on the rising adoption of nudging has increasingly proliferated in the broader social sciences over the past decades, nudging in education–what we designate here as Edunudge–is, however, only starting to be given substantial academic attention and still requires more nuanced conceptual and empirical investigation. As we argue in this contribution, such investigations should not only carefully disentangle the enormous complexity of nudging in education, including the role of digital and automated technologies. Equally, they should take more systematically into account the traditional closeness of the fields of pedagogy and behavioral insights. In line with that argumentation, the goal of this article is to develop foundations of such an Edunudge research program, focusing on four different dimensions: the technomodalities, the political economy, the spacetimes, and the pedagogies of Edunudge. © 2022 The Author(s).

Linguistic Inquiry and Word Count 2015 (LIWC2015; Pennebaker et al. 2015) is one of the most versatile, yet easy to master instruments to transform any text into data, meeting the needs of psychologists who are not usually proficient in data science. Moreover, LIWC2015 is already available in multiple languages, which opens the door to exciting intercultural quests. The current article introduces the first Romanian version of LIWC2015, Ro-LIWC2015, and thus, contributes to the line of research concerning multilingual analysis. Throughout the paper, we describe the challenges of creating the Romanian dictionary and discuss other linguistics aspects, which could be useful for new adaptations of LIWC2015. Also, we present the results of two studies for assessing the criterion validity of Ro-LIWC2015. The first study focuses on the consistency between the Romanian and the English dictionaries in analyzing a corpus of books. The second study tests whether Ro-LIWC2015 can acquire linguistic differences in contrasting corpora. For this purpose, we analyzed posts from help-seeking forums for anxiety, depression, and health issues, and leveraged supervised learning to address several classification problems. The selected algorithm allows feature ranking, which facilitates more thorough interpretations. The linguistic markers extracted with Ro-LIWC2015 mirrored a number of disorder-specific features of depression and anxiety. Given the obtained results, this research encourages the use of Ro-LIWC2015 for hypothesis testing. © 2020, The Author(s).",Content analysis; LIWC2015; Machine learning; Mental health; Text analysis; Text mining,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus

Dementia is not a mere individual health issue, since its interference with the ability to carry out daily activities entails a series of collateral problems, comprising exclusion of patients from civil rights and welfare, unpaid caregiving work, mostly performed by women, and an additional burden on the public healthcare systems. Thus, gender and wealth inequalities (both among individuals and among countries) tend to amplify the social impact of such a disease. Since at present there is no cure for dementia but only drug treatments to slow down its progress and mitigate the symptoms, it is essential to work on prevention and early diagnosis, identifying the risk factors that increase the probability of its onset. The complex and multifactorial etiology of dementia, resulting from an interplay between genetics and environmental factors, can benefit from a multidisciplinary approach that follows the “One Health” guidelines of the World Health Organization. Methods: In this work, we apply methods of Artificial Intelligence and complex systems physics to investigate the possibility to predict dementia prevalence throughout world countries from a set of variables concerning individual health, food consumption, substance use and abuse, healthcare system efficiency. The analysis uses publicly available indicator values at a country level, referred to a time window of 26 years. Results: Employing methods based on eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and complex networks, we identify a group of lifestyle factors, mostly concerning nutrition, that contribute the most to dementia incidence prediction. Discussion: The proposed approach provides a methodological basis to develop quantitative tools for action patterns against such a disease, which involves issues deeply related with sustainable, such as good health and resposible food consumption.

At present, the potentials of such smart solutions are often unclear, making it difficult for decision-makers to justify investments. To address this shortcoming, the Smart Campus is represented as an innovative testbed for smart and data-driven applications in the field of network-based UWI. During the last few years, the campus area of the University of Innsbruck has been comprehensively equipped with a variety of low-cost sensors for monitoring and controlling the UWI in high resolution (1-15 min). The experiences showed that the quality of service is influenced by the choice of communication technology and the installation location, thereby affecting the desired applications. Additionally, water distribution and urban drainage network including nature-based solutions have been integrated into an overall monitored system extended by measures to involve the urban population. This integrative approach allows the usage of synergies for the implementation and supports cross-system improvements (e.g., smart rainwater harvesting).

There are three elements to the model: content delivery through collaborative learning, skill development in an applied lab setting, and student mentorship. I apply this model to an experiential course where undergraduate students learn to create and conduct a national public opinion poll. The model addresses the need for university classes that equip undergraduate students with computational social science skills, and provides a pathway for training student researchers as teaching assistants for future courses. This model builds the research capacity of faculty, graduate assistants, and undergraduates, invests in data science by providing an infrastructure for the collection of large scale data over time, and integrates experiences inside and outside of the classroom.

The present 4IR era gave birth to big data sets and is beyond real estate professionals' analysis techniques. This has led to a situation where most real estate professionals rely on their intuition while neglecting a rigorous analysis for real estate investment appraisals. The heavy reliance on their intuition has been responsible for the under-performance of real estate investment, especially in Africa. Design/methodology/approach: This study utilised a survey questionnaire to randomly source data from real estate professionals. The questionnaire was analysed using a combination of Statistical package for social science (SPSS) V24 and Analysis of a Moment Structures (AMOS) graphics V27 software. Exploratory factor analysis was employed to break down the variables (drivers) into meaningful dimensions helpful in developing the conceptual framework. The framework was validated using covariance-based structural equation modelling. The model was validated using fit indices like discriminant validity, standardised root mean square (SRMR), comparative fit index (CFI), Normed Fit Index (NFI), etc. Findings: The model revealed that an inclusive educational system, decentralised real estate market and data management system are the major drivers for applying data science techniques to real estate professionals. Also, real estate professionals' application of the drivers will guarantee an effective data analysis of real estate investments. Originality/value: Numerous studies have clamoured for adopting data science techniques for real estate professionals. There is a lack of studies on the drivers that will guarantee the successful adoption of data science techniques. A modern form of data analysis for real estate professionals was also proposed in the study. © 2022, Emerald Publishing Limited.",Data science; Decentralised market; Fourth industrial revolution; Inclusive educational system; Real estate professional,,English,Article,Article in press,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus

Therefore, it is critical to accurately assess the current state of community functionality and resilience under this pandemic for successful recovery. To this end, various types of social sensing tools, such as tweeting and publicly released news, have been employed to understand individuals' and communities' thoughts, behaviors, and attitudes during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, some portions of the released news are fake and can easily mislead the community to respond improperly to disasters like COVID-19. This paper aims to assess the correlation between various news and tweets collected during the COVID-19 pandemic on community functionality and resilience. We use fact-checking organizations to classify news as real, mixed, or fake, and machine learning algorithms to classify tweets as real or fake to measure and compare community resilience (CR). Based on the news articles and tweets collected, we quantify CR based on two key factors, community wellbeing and resource distribution, where resource distribution is assessed by the level of economic resilience and community capital. Based on the estimates of these two factors, we quantify CR from both news articles and tweets and analyze the extent to which CR measured from the news articles can reflect the actual state of CR measured from tweets. To improve the operationalization and sociological significance of this work, we use dimension reduction techniques to integrate the dimensions.  © 2020 Tsinghua University Press.",community resilience; computational social science; data science; fake news; machine learning; social computing; social media; urban computing,Fake detection; Learning algorithms; Machine learning; Social sciences computing; Community resiliences; Computational social science; Fake news; Machine-learning; News articles; Resource distribution; Social computing; Social media; Urban computing; Wellbeing; COVID-19,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus

In our study the discursive framing of depression is explored in online health communities. Three discursive frameworks are introduced: the bio-medical, psychological, and social framings of depression. ~80 000 posts were collected, and a sample of them was manually classified. Conventional bag-of-words models, Gradient Boosting Machine, word-embedding-based models and a state-of-the-art Transformer-based model with transfer learning, called DistilBERT were applied to expand this classification on the whole database. According to our experience ‘discursive framing’ proves to be a complex and hermeneutically difficult concept, which affects the degree of both inter-annotator agreement and predictive performance. Our finding confirms that the level of inter-annotator disagreement provides a good estimate for the objective difficulty of the classification. By identifying the most important terms, we also interpreted the classification algorithms, which is of great importance in social sciences. We are convinced that machine learning techniques can extend the horizon of qualitative text analysis. Our paper supports a smooth fit of the new techniques into the traditional toolbox of social sciences. © 2022, The Author(s).",Framing of depression; Gradient boosting machine; Natural language processing; Online forums; Supervised machine learning; Transformer-based model,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus

The book situates digital-era problems relative to those of previous sociotechnical milieux and argues that technical advance perennially embeds corrosive effects on social relations and relations of production, recognizing variation across contexts and relative to entrenched societal hierarchies of race and other axes of difference and their intersections. Societal tolerance, despite abundant evidence for harmful effects of digital technologies, requires attention. The book explains blindness to social injustice by technocratic thinking delivered through education as well as truths embraced in the data sciences coupled with governance in universities and the private sector that protect these truths from critique. Institutional inertia suggests benefits of communitarianism, which strives for change emanating from civil society. Scaling postcapitalist communitarian values through communitybased peer production presents opportunities. However, enduring problems require critical reflection, continual revision of strategies, and active participation among diverse community citizens.

In line with guidelines presented in the GAISE College Report, this article demonstrates intuitive approaches to teaching proportion and mean inference that take advantage of statistical software and emphasize conceptual understanding. The article recommends putting aside asymptotic-based methods for proportion inference and using the exact binomial method. Regarding mean inference, we propose a more contextualized and simplified process that uses the distribution of the sample mean directly and avoids standardized statistics such as z or t.

With the number of characterized compounds exceeding 100,000, manual sorting becomes impossible. At the same time, the increasing computer power and established use of automated machine learning approaches makes data science tools available, that provide an overview of the MOF chemical space and support the selection of suitable MOFs for a desired application. Among the different data science tools, graph theory approaches, where data generated from numerous real-world applications is represented as a graph (network) of interconnected objects, has been widely used in a variety of scientific fields such as social sciences, health informatics, biological sciences, agricultural sciences and economics. We describe the application of a particular graph theory approach known as social network analysis to MOF materials and highlight the importance of community (group) detection and graph node centrality. In this first application of the social network analysis approach to MOF chemical space, we created MOFSocialNet. This social network is based on the geometrical descriptors of MOFs available in the CoRE-MOFs database. MOFSocialNet can discover communities with similar MOFs structures and identify the most representative MOFs within a given community. In addition, analysis of MOFSocialNet using social network analysis methods can predict MOF properties more accurately than conventional ML tools.

The literature review is performed in order to give a review of different approaches and methods that have been applied so far. The most used method in social sciences and management is the SWOT method, for the identification of strengths, weaknesses, opportunities, and threats when making strategic decisions. Two fundamental characteristics of previous approaches are the development of numerical models of utility functions and the possibility of upgrading these models by formalizing the intuition of strategic decision-makers. There are several shortcomings of the existing approaches. The application of computational intelligence and machine learning methods in social sciences is identified as one of the most challenging and promising areas, which could overcome identified shortcomings. The principles of one popular machine learning method, the decision tree, are explained and a demonstration is performed on the case study of churn prediction. Benchmarking data set from the publicly available repository is used to demonstrate the suggested approach Evaluation results measured through model accuracy and reliability gave promising results for further analysis. A developed predictive model could serve as a standalone tool or as support for decision-making in social sciences. © 2023 World Scientific and Engineering Academy and Society.

World Wide Web is an example of these big data. It has become a vast data production and consumption platform, at which threads of data evolve from multiple devices, by different human interactions, over worldwide locations, under divergent distributed settings. Embedded in these big web data is implicit, previously unknown and potentially useful information and knowledge that awaited to be discovered. This calls for web intelligence solutions, which make good use of data science and data mining (especially, web mining or social network mining) to discover useful knowledge and important information from the web. As a web mining task, web structure mining aims to examine incoming and outgoing links on web pages and make recommendations of frequently referenced web pages to web surfers. As another web mining task, web usage mining aims to examine web surfer patterns and make recommendations of frequently visited pages to web surfers. While the size of the web is huge, the connection among all web pages may be sparse. In other words, the number of vertex nodes (i.e., web pages) on the web is huge, the number of directed edges (i.e., incoming and outgoing hyperlinks between web pages) may be small. This leads to a sparse web. In this paper, we present a solution for interpretable mining of frequent patterns from sparse web. In particular, we represent web structure and usage information by bitmaps to capture connections to web pages. Due to the sparsity of the web, we compress the bitmaps, and use them in mining influential patterns (e.g., popular web pages). For explainability of the mining process, we ensure the compressed bitmaps are interpretable. Evaluation on real-life web data demonstrates the effectiveness, interpretability and practicality of our solution for interpretable mining of influential patterns from sparse web.  © 2022 IEEE.",Bitmap; Data analytics; Data compression; Data mining; Data science; Explainability; Frequent pattern mining; Intelligent agent technology; Interpretability; Recom-mendation; Web intelligence; Web mining; Web of data; Web structure mining; Web usage mining; World wide web,Big data; Data Analytics; Data compression; Data Science; Hypertext systems; Information use; Social networking (online); Social sciences computing; Bit maps; Data analytics; Explainability; Frequent patterns minings; Intelligent agent technology; Interpretability; Recom-mendation; Web intelligence; Web Mining; Web of datum; Web structure mining; Web usage mining; Data mining,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus

In many cases, they have become part of the usual landscape of solving new or old problems in different fields of human knowledge. In this progress, there are several aspects, especially three aspects: the availability and universality of data in many fields of human activities; a deeper understanding of the mathematics of the basic control algorithm; and the availability and capability of hardware and computing which allows a wide range and a large number of data experiments. Considering these aspects, the key challenge for each problem and application area is to understand how to use these technologies, to what extent they may reach, and what constraints need to be overcome in order to obtain beneficial results (in terms of production cost, value, etc.). This challenge includes identifying data sources and their integration and recovery requirements, the necessity and cost of acquiring or constructing tag data set s, volume data required for measurement, verifying its feasibility, technical method of data analysis task and its consistency with the final application goal, and social and communication sciences are no exception. The knowledge in these fields is related to artificial intelligence, but they do have particularities that define the most appropriate type of artificial intelligence technology and method (i.e. natural language processing). The successful use of AI technology in these disciplines involves not only technical knowledge, but also the establishment of a viable application environment, including the availability of data, the appropriate complexity of tasks to be performed, and verification procedures with experts in the field. This paper introduces the methodology of generating artificial intelligence model, summarizes the artificial intelligence methods and services most likely to be used in social and communication sciences, and finally gives some application examples to illustrate the practical and technical considerations in this regard. © 2022 by author(s) and Frontier Scientific Publishing.",Artificial Intelligence; Data Science; Machine Learning; Social Science,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus

It has been widely used in social science, data science, public health, information technology, and the U.S. decennial census. Nevertheless, to guarantee differential privacy, existing methods may unavoidably alter the conclusion of original data analysis, as privatization often changes the sample distribution. This phenomenon is known as the trade-off between privacy protection and statistical accuracy. In this work, we mitigate this trade-off by developing a distribution-invariant privatization (DIP) method to reconcile both high statistical accuracy and strict differential privacy. As a result, any downstream statistical or machine learning task yields essentially the same conclusion as if one used the original data. Numerically, under the same strictness of privacy protection, DIP achieves superior statistical accuracy in in a wide range of simulation studies and real-world benchmarks. © 2022 Elsevier B.V.",Data perturbation; Data sharing; Distribution preservation; Privacy protection; Randomized mechanism,Data privacy; Economic and social effects; Social sciences computing; Data perturbation; Data Sharing; Differential privacies; Distribution preservation; Gold standards; Privacy protection; Randomized mechanism; Shared data; Statistical accuracy; Trade off; Privatization,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus

In fact the opinions of these influencers are at the core of decision-making strategies, and are leading trends on the virtual social media landscape. Moreover, influencers might play a crucial role when it comes to misinformation and conspiracy during sensitive, controversial and trending events. However, due to the dynamic and unrestricted nature of social media, and diversity of targeted topics and audiences, identifying and ranking key influencers that are impactful, credible, and knowledgeable about their specialist topic or event remains an evolving and open research paradigm.

Among these, the local political climate in the postmigration phase is an important determinant which operates at interpersonal and institutional levels. We present a conceptual framework to advance theory, measurement and empirical evidence related to the small-area factors which shape and determine the local political climate, as these may translate into variations in health outcomes among refugees, migrants and other marginalised population groups. Using the example of Germany, we present evidence of small-area variation in factors defining political climates, and present and discuss potential pathways from local political climates to health outcomes. We show that anti-immigrant and antirefugee violence is a Europe-wide phenomenon and elaborate how resilience of individuals, communities, and the health system may function as moderator of the effects of the local political climate on health outcomes.

Data science uses scientific and computational tools to extract valuable knowledge from large data sets. Once data is processed and cleaned, it is analyzed and presented to support decision-making processes. Data science and machine learning tools have become widely used in companies of all sizes. Networks are often large-scale, decentralized, and evolve dynamically over time. Mining complex networks aim to understand the principles governing the organization and the behavior of such networks is crucial for a broad range of fields of study. Here are a few selected typical applications of mining networks: Community detection (which users on some social media platforms are close friends). Link prediction (who is likely to connect to whom on such platforms). Node attribute prediction (what advertisement should be shown to a given user of a particular platform to match their interests). Influential node detection (which social media users would be the best ambassadors of a specific product).

Datification is the new representation tool within social sciences. The objectives of data science are the classification of what have happened and the prevision of what will happen. The anticipation of the future is not confined to irrelevant marketing areas, it includes very sensible situations in which social and human rights are involved. Humans can assume the responsibility of their perspective, humans can change their mind, they can assess the variability and multiplicity of preferences and find negotiated political solutions to common problems, though their judgements are fallible. Humans possess the «sense of possibility» introduced by Musil that, according to Bernard Stiegler, we can interpret as a «thought within entropy». This algorithmic attitude towards future risks to reduce the adaptability of human beings. If we accept to base every judgement on a calculation, even when circumstances do not allow a complete and exhaustive measurement of all element of the situation, we risk misunderstanding the context, being incapable of reacting appropriately when facing external, unpredictable conditions.

Urban green spaces provide ecosystem services that can help to mitigate the effects of these challenges. Urban green spaces such as parks, urban gardens and street trees regulate the microclimate and buffer noise as well as a variety of air pollutants. Parks promote physical activity, relaxation and social interaction. The potential to provide these services might be limited during extreme weather events such as heat waves and drought periods. With this experience-based perspective paper, we introduce an interdisciplinary project that consists of multi-method field campaigns to assess the potential of urban parks to provide regulating and recreational ecosystem services in the context of the 2018 and 2019 heat and drought periods in Germany. We highlight that multi-method field campaigns that combine sensor-based environmental measurements with social science approaches, including visitor observations, counts, and questionnaire surveys, are highly useful when urbanisation and climate change-related challenges must be effectively addressed in the context of the complex socio-ecological systems of a city. Based on our hands-on experiences, we provide recommendations for local urban green space planning and outline prospects for future research. (Figure presented.). © 2021 The Author(s).

Virtual access has become the need-of-the-hour, and the uses of cloud-based course content delivery, distance learning, and document collaboration are becoming increasingly ubiquitous. This paper introduces a novel method to allow students and faculty in the Humanities, Arts, and Social Sciences (HASS) to collaborate and interact through data analytical technologies using ""interactive Digital Computational Notebooks"" (iDCNs). We demonstrate this approach using a digitized Legacy of Slavery (LoS) archival dataset collection from the Maryland State Archives (MSA) and illustrate the socio-technical challenges in establishing this learning environment. We provide a step-by-step process involved in accessing, developing, and integrating different infrastructure elements. The LoS [1] in Maryland is a major initiative of the MSA. The program seeks to preserve and promote the vast universe of experiences that have shaped the lives of Maryland’s African American population. Over the last 18 years, some 420,000 individuals have been identified, and data assembled into 16 major databases. These databases contain information unique to enslaved people’s lives, such as manumission records, certificates of freedom, census data, penitentiary records, etc. One of this paper’s primary objectives is to enable the digital representation of these culturally rich and sensitive collections ready to be analyzed and studied through contemporary scholars’ lenses. This project aims to achieve this goal by making these databases available and accessible so that users can generate individual stories, glean insights, and possibly recover “erased” memories of enslaved people. To achieve this goal, as a first step, unique dataset collections were prepared by downloading the databases and put through rigorous exploration, cleaning, and visualization process through coordination with interdisciplinary scholars composed of archivists, historians, computer scientists, and technology analysts. This project also illustrates the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to a unique set of digitized archival data with a specific focus on contextual aspects due to the data’s historical value and sensitivity. The collaborative process used open-source and readily accessible tools to create meaningful visualizations as an arrangement that flows together conducive for educators to teach. The visualizations use the spatial and temporal characteristics of the datasets to produce graphs and charts for a graphical view of the datasets. The visualizations constructed are responsive to present the data by instant connections to the datasets dynamically. The integration of these digital artifacts obtained from each dataset was carried out through Jupyter Notebooks (JNs). These iDCNs are unlike the traditional digital notebooks that provide a space for students to take notes and collect clippings of text. Instead, the iDCNs developed in this project are a novel set of educational tools that allow text and software code to co-exist and be rendered in a single document coherently for instructors and students to follow the text with visual representations back-to-back. The iDCNs are also equipped with live examples of basic natural language processing on certain text-rich features of these dataset collections. The open-source nature of this project’s setup and cloud-based distribution of these digital artifacts pave the way for students from under served communities to take advantage of a unique way of learning and to perform hands-on work on marketable software tools, preparing them for a successful career. The contributions of this paper to the fields of HASS and other non-STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) backgrounds lie in the idea of providing an “always-on” cloud-based pedagogical environment for aspiring students and researchers worldwide to analyze, learn and unearth stories through data science driven approach on a cultural dataset, in our case, the LoS dataset collection. © Copyright owned by the author(s) under the terms of the Creative Commons",Cloud-based digital learning; Computational Archival Science; Computational Thinking; Interactive Digital Computational Notebooks,"Arts computing; Computer aided instruction; Database systems; E-learning; History; Human computer interaction; Population statistics; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics); Visualization; Cloud-based; Cloud-based digital learning; Computational archival science; Computational thinkings; Digital artifacts; Digital-learning; Interactive digital computational notebook; Maryland; Open-source; Science learning; Curricula",English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus

However, the recent emergence of fourth generation in the literature offers prospects for overcoming them. The article presents a new, falsifiable theoretical model that pursues this aim. Thus, it begins with discussion of the promise and pitfalls of the fourth generation. Next, the alignment of strategic culture with new institutionalism is explored. This is followed by an introduction of discursive institutionalism and its potential for advancing the fourth-generation theory building. Then, a new falsifiable fourth-generation discursive-institutionalist strategic culture model is presented. The concluding section discusses the operationalization of the model via network analysis using social data science methods. © 2020 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",computational social science; discursive institutionalism; international relations theory; social data science; Strategic culture,,English,Article,Final,,Scopus

In this study, the authors use a data science approach to discover a set of quantitative social dimensions based on the World Values Survey, a nationally representative survey covering 60 countries and 90,000 individuals. Five national social dimensions, representing 198 questions and 56 countries are discovered using multidimensional item response theory (MIRT). They are (1) Religiosity, (2) Neutrality, (3) Fairness, (4) Skepticism, and (5) Societal Tranquility. This approach is unique from previous quantitative models because it groups responses by country and analyzes binary, nominal, and ordinal survey questions. It is possible today due to recent advancements in computing power and programming. Furthermore, this methodology tests the validity of previous quantitative dimensions and finds that some of the existing social and cultural dimensions are not clearly discernable. Therefore, this model provides not only more a rigorous methodology but also new social dimensions which more accurately quantify underlying differences across countries in the World Values Survey. Like other quantitative cross-cultural models, this model is a deeply simplified representation of national social differences. However, it is a useful tool for modeling national differences and can be used to help us understand the impacts of social preferences and values on different political, economic, and development variables.

The traditional approach to this is very stringent by trying to find causal explanations and models. However, this approach has been recently criticized for preventing progress due to neglecting prediction abilities of models that support more problem-oriented approaches. The latter models would be enabled by the surge of big Web-data currently available. Interestingly, this problem cannot be overcome with methods from computational social science (CSS) alone because this field is dominated by simulation-based approaches and descriptive models. In this article, we address this issue and argue that the combination of big social data with social networks is needed for creating prediction models. We will argue that this alliance has the potential for gradually establishing a causal social theory. In order to emphasize the importance of integrating big social data with social networks, we call this approach data-driven computational social network science (DD-CSNS). © Copyright © 2021 Emmert-Streib and Dehmer.",causal models; computational social science; data science; network science; prediction models; social data; social sciences; web experiments,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus

To address the challenges posed by the data deluge, the discipline of data science has arisen, and an increasing number of universities are offering undergraduate data science programs. Many of these programs have their origins in a computer science or a statistics department, leading to a data science curriculum that is more heavily weighted toward computing or statistics. By contrast, the data science program described in this paper is a joint endeavor between computer science and statistics that seeks to provide balanced training in both areas. Its broad goals are to produce students who (a) are well-trained in both computer science and statistics, (b) are equipped with specialized datarelated skills that are not normally taught in either of those disciplines, and (c) can apply their skills to a domain area. This paper reports on the author's experiences leading the effort to create this program, which has seen good growth, received positive feedback from students, and is successfully preparing students for internships. We offer this report in the hope that it may serve as a model for other institutions considering the addition of an undergraduate data science program. © 2020 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).

Social science areas frequently address latent variables, whose study is mainly guided by a deductive paradigm and requires a confirmatory scope. Both areas, data science and latent variable research, have ample development, but their combination is not mature. The objective is to develop a practical and reproducible framework for data science projects from a psychometric perspective for the study of latent variables. The framework is practical and integrative, and consists of nine steps, which guide from the construct definition, discovery and confirmed patterns (structural equation modelling and considering goodness-of-fit, reliability, validity, equity and subjects’ segmentation) to the use of patterns. This last step includes three sub-steps: one for structural hypotheses contrast and two computational approaches (supervised: machine learning; and non-supervised: principal component analysis).

With the advent of global digitalization, corporations are striving for winning culture strategies with the ambition to integrate seamlessly into the digital revolution and thus to succeed in the competitive, global market. During the last two years, research into the evaluation and transformation of corporate culture leveraging Natural Language Processing techniques has become increasingly notable. One interesting question that exists in this context is: can we reasonably explain corporate culture via analyzing corporations' mission, vision, and strategy statements? To tackle this problem, first we have collected some representative mission, vision, and strategy statements from 257 corporations operating in Switzerland, Germany, and Austria. Subsequently, leveraging word and sentence embedding models in Natural Language Processing, we have measured the so-called Big-9 cultural values: agility, collaboration, customer, diversity, execution, innovation, integrity, performance, and respect. Furthermore, the corporate culture reflected in texts of mission and vision has been validated using the external datasets from MyCareerGate, x28, and Glassdoor Culture 500, showing the preliminary effectiveness of our proposed methods and the potential challenges in evaluating corporate culture. Finally, more strategic solutions have been suggested regarding which firsthand data must be additionally collected and how to leverage these data for a comprehensive assessment of corporate culture.  © 2021 IEEE.",corporate culture; corporation; digitalization; mission and vision; Natural Language Processing; text analytics; word and sentence embeddings,Data Science; International trade; Comprehensive assessment; Corporate culture; Cultural value; Digital revolution; Global market; NAtural language processing; Strategic solutions; Switzerland; Natural language processing systems,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus

With that have also come initiatives for guidance on how to develop “responsible AI” aligned with human and ethical values. Compared to sectors like energy, healthcare, or transportation, the use of AI-based techniques in the water domain is relatively modest. This paper presents a review of current AI applications in the water domain and develops some tentative insights as to what “responsible AI” could mean there. Building on the reviewed literature, four categories of application are identified: modeling, prediction and forecasting, decision support and operational management, and optimization. We also identify three insights pertaining to the water sector in particular: the use of AI techniques in general, and many-objective optimization in particular, that allow for a pluralism of values and changing values; the use of theory-guided data science, which can avoid some of the pitfalls of strictly data-driven models; and the ability to build on experiences with participatory decision-making in the water sector. These insights suggest that the development and application of responsible AI techniques for the water sector should not be left to data scientists alone, but requires concerted effort by water professionals and data scientists working together, complemented with expertise from the social sciences and humanities. © 2020 The Author",Artificial intelligence; Data science; Ethics; Many-objective optimization; Responsible AI; Water domain,Artificial Intelligence; Forecasting; Humans; Water; Data Science; Decision making; Decision support systems; Decision theory; bromide; trihalomethane; water; AI applications; Data-driven model; Decision supports; Development and applications; Many-objective optimizations; Operational management; Prediction and forecasting; Water professionals; artificial intelligence; decision support system; ethics; forecasting method; modeling; optimization; planning method; prediction; technology adoption; water industry; Article; artificial intelligence; concentration (parameter); data science; decision making; decision support system; digitalization; environmental parameters; ethics; machine learning; many objective optimization; non maleficence; organization; predictive value; priority journal; privacy; process optimization; responsible use; snow water equivalent; social behavior; social responsibility; society; sociology; transparency; value pluralism; water sector; forecasting; human; Artificial intelligence,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus

A self-prepared questionnaire was developed, distributed, and filled by physicians (n = 100) from different departments at Benghazi Medical Center, Libya. The Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) program was used to analyze the results. The results showed that more than 90% of physicians preferred the e-Prescribing software, with most of them believing that they were able to provide better services to patients by saving time and effort (87%), and checking drug interaction (82%), as well as reducing medical errors (89%). On the other hand, the results indicated that the main barriers are the lack of adequate infrastructure, awareness sessions, and human and material resources. Physicians prefer to use the e-Prescribing software, as it supports decision-makers to design more effective strategies and implementation plans.

This study systematically surveyed how machine learning has been applied at different stages of building life cycle. By conducting a literature search on the Web of Knowledge platform, we found 9579 papers in this field and selected 153 papers for an in-depth review. The number of published papers is increasing year by year, with a focus on building design, operation, and control. However, no study was found using machine learning in building commissioning. There are successful pilot studies on fault detection and diagnosis of HVAC equipment and systems, load prediction, energy baseline estimate, load shape clustering, occupancy prediction, and learning occupant behaviors and energy use patterns. None of the existing studies were adopted broadly by the building industry, due to common challenges including (1) lack of large scale labeled data to train and validate the model, (2) lack of model transferability, which limits a model trained with one data-rich building to be used in another building with limited data, (3) lack of strong justification of costs and benefits of deploying machine learning, and (4) the performance might not be reliable and robust for the stated goals, as the method might work for some buildings but could not be generalized to others. Findings from the study can inform future machine learning research to improve occupant comfort, energy efficiency, demand flexibility, and resilience of buildings, as well as to inspire young researchers in the field to explore multidisciplinary approaches that integrate building science, computing science, data science, and social science. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Artificial intelligence; Building control; Building life cycle; Building performance; Buildings; Machine learning,Architectural design; Artificial intelligence; Buildings; Construction industry; Energy efficiency; Energy utilization; Fault detection; Green computing; Labeled data; Learning systems; Life cycle; Social computing; Social sciences computing; Structural design; Building controls; Building life cycle; Building performance; Fault detection and diagnosis; Machine learning research; Model transferabilities; Multi-disciplinary approach; Research and application; Machine learning,English,Review,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus

Yet, as a precondition for setting up an educational programme within an academic institution, one needs to be able to delineate the discipline being taught (Sinclair and Gouglas 2002, 168) in terms of a coherent academic identity, interrelations between courses, and skills that graduates will attain. Therefore any locally situated educational enterprise needs to focus on those areas of DH that can be reasonably tied to research conducted at the hosting institution. At the University of Helsinki, we have put particular effort into defining our educational profile in interdisciplinary computational humanities, taught both as a minor studies module (30 ECTS) and an MA track (120 ECTS). Because of the complexities of humanities data and the lack of standard protocols for dealing with it, it is very difficult for a humanities scholar to apply computational and statistical methods in a trustworthy manner without specialist help. At the same time, neither can computer scientists, statisticians or physicists answer humanities questions on their own, even if they understand the algorithms. Our solution to this problem is to argue that computational humanities research, and as a consequence also digital humanities education, should be fundamentally interdisciplinary endeavours, where statisticians, computer scientists and scholars in the humanities work together to develop, test and apply the methodology to solve humanities questions. Our version of computational humanities thus exists precisely and solely at the intersection of humanities and computer science rather than as separate from either of them. Consequently, people participating in this field should primarily anchor their academic profile to one of the parent disciplines instead of trying to find an identity purely in the middle. This is reflected in our educational approach. We provide students in the humanities with instruction on how to use ready-made tools, workflows or applied programming, granting them a general digital competency and agency, but our focus is on developing a broader literacy regarding data and computational methods. By learning to contextualize their skills within the field of computational humanities as a whole, the humanities students also learn to assess where their personal boundaries lie, and where an interdisciplinary collaboration is required instead. In this context, their computational literacy also helps them converse with the methodological experts coming to the field from computer science. In this interdisciplinary setting, we take a project-based approach to learning, tying teaching to actual research projects being conducted at the faculty. This approach both harnesses the varying competencies of our students and provides an excellent basis for learning interdisciplinary collaboration (Bell 2010). The culmination of our project courses is the Digital Humanities Hackathon, a multidisciplinary collaboration between the University of Helsinki digital humanities programme and the data science programmes at the Department of Computer Science and Aalto University. For researchers and students from computer and data sciences, the Hackathon is an opportunity to test their abstract knowledge against complex real-life problems; for people from the humanities and social sciences, it shows what is possible to achieve with such collaboration. For both, the Hackathon gives the experience of working with people from different backgrounds as part of an interdisciplinary team and simulates group work in such professional settings as the students may find themselves in after graduation, acculturating them to work outside academia (cf. Rockwell and Sinclair 2012). Our conception of computational humanities as intrinsically collaborative and interdisciplinary is based on the realisation that the traditional, single-author research culture of the humanities is a hindrance to successfully integrating computational approaches into humanities research.

Building on precision public health, we propose precision global health (PGH), an approach that leverages life sciences, social sciences, and data sciences, augmented with artificial intelligence (AI), in order to identify transnational problems and deliver targeted and impactful interventions through integrated and participatory approaches. With more than four billion Internet users across the globe and the accelerating power of AI, PGH taps on our current augmented capacity to collect, integrate, analyse and visualise large volumes of data, both non-specific and specific to health. With the support of governments and donors, and together with international and non-governmental organisations, universities and research institutions can generate innovative solutions to improve health and wellbeing of the most vulnerable populations around the world. In line with the Sustainable Development Goals, we propose here a road map for the development and implementation of PGH. © 2020 Authors.

This essay focuses on the question of cumulation, and why the kind of cumulation that is characteristic of social data science is more akin to cumulation in the natural sciences. The reasons for this include how research teams are organized and how they compete to exploit certain data sets to improve upon the work of other teams. There are other factors, however, that mitigate against cumulation, including the lack of access to certain datasets and a lack of building on existing findings in the social sciences. Some of these factors pertain to fundamental philosophical issues in social science, including new ideas about the workings of causal explanation. Others relate to the collaboration or absence of collaboration between different disciplines and to the difference between more applied and more academic research. The essay reviews these factors and develops an account of cumulation anchored in a realist philosophy of science and in the practices and tasks of social science research. It concludes with a call for big data research to be more integrated with already ongoing cumulative findings in the social sciences while recognizing that there are several obstacles to such an integration. © 2019 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.",Big data; causation; cumulation; disciplinarity; social data science,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus

Social networking sites and applications handle a large volume of data. As more personal information flows in and out of social networks, data privacy and security in the social network become a topic of discussion and arguments. This chapter emphasizes data privacy and also differentiates privacy from security. Initial sections of the chapter explain privacy in its elementary form as a need and right of a human being under the perspective of anthropology and behavioral science. Personal data privacy, its current scenario, threats and its protection by law and policymaking by various governments around the world are discussed further. The chapter considers social networking beyond networking sites and applications, and hence a discussion on privacy threats for sensitive data which spread across fields such as health data, forensic, smart toys, image and video surveillance is also analyzed. Positives and negatives of social network’s underlying technologies, like machine learning, artificial intelligence, data sciences, the internet of things and blockchain are discussed in terms of data privacy. The personal data privacy measures imposed by law that need to be incorporated as the part of privacy policies of organizations or that need to be implemented with the support of data security mechanisms are discussed in the last part of the chapter. © 2022, The Author(s), under exclusive license to Springer Nature Singapore Pte Ltd.",Data privacy; Data privacy law; Data Protection Act; Data security; Personal data; Sensitive data; Social networking,Artificial intelligence; Behavioral research; Data Science; Health risks; Network security; Security systems; Social networking (online); Social sciences computing; Behavioral science; Data privacy and securities; Personal information; Privacy policies; Privacy threats; Security mechanism; Social networking sites; Video surveillance; Data privacy,English,Book chapter,Final,,Scopus

Four types of relationships anthropologists historically have tended to seek out with data science as a discipline: anthropology of data science, anthropology over data science, anthropology with data science and, the least developed of the four, anthropology by data science. I relate potential insights data scientists have cultivated on abductive, bottom-up quantitative research that might be useful for anthropologists in particular and cybernetically minded thinkers in general. Grounded Nick Seaver’s concept of bastard disciplines and methodologies, an anthropology by data science relationship provides a beneficial way to ground such strategic incorporations within anthropological research and helpful food for thought for cybernetic scholars in other disciplinary contexts. © 2021 Intellect Ltd Article.

It also represents a convergence of different fields with different ways of thinking about and doing science. The goal of this Perspective is to provide some clarity around how these approaches differ from one another and to propose how they might be productively integrated. Towards this end we make two contributions. The first is a schema for thinking about research activities along two dimensions—the extent to which work is explanatory, focusing on identifying and estimating causal effects, and the degree of consideration given to testing predictions of outcomes—and how these two priorities can complement, rather than compete with, one another. Our second contribution is to advocate that computational social scientists devote more attention to combining prediction and explanation, which we call integrative modelling, and to outline some practical suggestions for realizing this goal. © 2021, Springer Nature Limited.",,"Computer Simulation; Data Science; Forecasting; Goals; Humans; Models, Theoretical; Social Sciences; data set; detection method; earthquake prediction; integrated approach; modeling; prediction; two-dimensional modeling; attention; human; human experiment; prediction; review; sociology; thinking; computer simulation; forecasting; motivation; procedures; sociology; theoretical model",English,Review,Final,,Scopus

Data science is a new and interdisciplinary STEM-oriented domain, integrating knowledge and skills from computer science, mathematics, and statistics with an application domain, from which the data draw their context and meaning. Data science applications are relevant for various domains, and therefore, a variety of populations are increasingly attracted to learning it. Addressing the theme of the conference, i.e., 'Women in Engineering', in this paper we describe a data science workshop for social sciences and digital humanities researchers. A significant majority (83%) of the participants of this workshop self-identified as women. This gender proportion, the opposite of that prevailing in STEM studies, led us to examine the workshop from a gender perspective. Our results indicate that the women participating in the data science workshop perceived it as an opportunity to acquire research tools rather than programming tools. We suggest that framing the workshop as a research tool workshop and not as a programming workshop reduced prevalent gender barriers in STEM, encouraging a majority of women researchers to participate. In this paper, we elaborate on the participants' perceptions about data science and programming and analyze them based on three theoretical perspectives: expectancy value theory, the interdisciplinary perspective, and the epistemological perspective. © 2021 IEEE.",Data science; Data science education; Gender balance; Interdisciplinary of data science,"Engineering education; Population statistics; Professional aspects; STEM (science, technology, engineering and mathematics); Digital humanities; Expectancy-value theory; Oriented domains; Programming tools; Science , Technology , Engineering and Mathematics; Science applications; Science workshops; Women in engineering; Data Science",English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus

This paper reviews problems of trustworthiness in what we term pervasive data research: scholarship that relies on the rich information generated about people through digital interaction. We highlight the entwined problems of participant unawareness of such research and the relationship of pervasive data research to corporate datafication and surveillance. We suggest a way forward by drawing from the history of a different methodological approach in which researchers have struggled with trustworthy practice: ethnography. To grapple with the colonial legacy of their methods, ethnographers have developed analytic lenses and researcher practices that foreground relations of awareness and power. These lenses are inspiring but also challenging for pervasive data research, given the flattening of contexts inherent in digital data collection. We propose ways that pervasive data researchers can incorporate reflection on awareness and power within their research to support the development of trustworthy data science. © The Author(s) 2021.",Big data; computational social science; data science; digital phenotyping; personal sensing; research ethics; research methods; social media data,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus

Data science draws from methodology developed in such fields as applied mathematics, statistics, machine learning, data mining, data management, visualization, and HCI. It drives discoveries in business, economy, biology, medicine, environmental science, the physical sciences, the humanities and social sciences, and beyond. Machine learning and data mining and visualization are integral parts of data science, and essential to enable sophisticated analysis of data. Nevertheless, both research areas are currently still rather separated and investigated by different communities rather independently. The goal of this workshop is to bring researchers from both communities together in order to discuss common interests, to talk about practical issues in application-related projects, and to identify open research problems.

Despite its prominence within social science research, relatively little attention has been paid to the process of data acquisition. To that end, our research uses a case study to illustrate the process of acquiring and storing tweets. To construct our data pipeline, we first applied for and created Twitter developer accounts and used the Tweepy app in Python to interact with Twitter's API. We created a program that uses a producer-consumer multithreading model to request tweets from the API, then cleans the data and pushes it to a MySQL database with four tables: one for tweets, one for user information, one for retweets, and one for special entities (e.g., hashtags).With our pipeline operational, we explore how candidate gender affects Twitter discourse in the 2020 Democratic presidential primary. Specifically, we use unsupervised text analysis methods to examine differences in word frequencies, sentiment, and emotional dimensions. We find that gender is central to the discourse surrounding female candidates, but peripheral for male candidates. The discourse surrounding female candidates in our dataset is also more joyful and positive. Finally, with our case study concluded, we offer lessons to future researchers who wish to acquire and utilize Twitter data for social science research. © 2020 IEEE.",API; data acquisition; data pipeline; data science; democratic primary; gender; politics; text analysis; Twitter,Behavioral research; Data acquisition; Social networking (online); Data pipelines; Emotional dimensions; Multi-threading; MySQL database; Social science research; Text-analysis methods; User information; Word frequencies; Pipelines,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus

Based on a specific use case in political polarization detection, we contribute an experimental method to find clusters in social media data and to explain the semantics of cluster membership using frequent word mentions. 100 dimensional word2vec word embedding vectors are generated from the raw text data. Based on this, three clustering approaches were tested: K-means, K-Means with Principal Components Analysis (PCA), and Deep Embedded Clustering (DEC). For K-Means, the optimal number of clusters was estimated visually. The performance of the clustering approaches was compared using the Silhouette score. Using PCA to reduce the dimensionality from 100 to only 2 most significant principal components had a significant performance impact, and combined with K-means, provided the best results. To explain the clusters visually, word counts of the most frequent words were plotted for three clusters. It became evident that the most frequent words per cluster explained the semantics of cluster membership in a consistent way. We conclude the following: our method demonstrates it is possible to find and explain meaningful clusters of users in social media data. Dimensionality reduction of text based on Word2Vec and PCA led to semantically coherent, clearly distinct clusters. Based on our understanding of the underlying use case, the clusters generated by the proposed method clearly reflect social phenomena that can be verified by a qualitative interpretation of the cluster visualizations. Thus, the proposed method can provide a basis for studying social behavior using social media data. © 2021 Copyright for this paper by its authors.

The main contribution of this work is three-fold: (1) we provide an up-to-date literature review of the state of the art on social network analysis (SNA); (2) we propose a set of new metrics based on four essential features (or dimensions) in SNA; (3) finally, we provide a quantitative analysis of a set of popular SNA tools and frameworks. We have also performed a scientometric study to detect the most active research areas and application domains in this area. This work proposes the definition of four different dimensions, namely Pattern & Knowledge discovery, Information Fusion & Integration, Scalability, and Visualization, which are used to define a set of new metrics (termed degrees) in order to evaluate the different software tools and frameworks of SNA (a set of 20 SNA-software tools are analyzed and ranked following previous metrics). These dimensions, together with the defined degrees, allow evaluating and measure the maturity of social network technologies, looking for both a quantitative assessment of them, as to shed light to the challenges and future trends in this active area. © 2020 Elsevier B.V.",Big data; Data science; Social data visualization; Social media mining; Social network analysis,Application programs; Social sciences computing; Computational technique; Essential features; Exponential growth; Literature reviews; Network based applications; Network technologies; Quantitative assessments; State of the art; Social networking (online),English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus

The spatial sciences have recently seen growing calls for more accessible software and tools that better embody geographic science and theory. Urban spatial network science offers one clear opportunity: from multiple perspectives, tools to model and analyze non-planar urban spatial networks have traditionally been inaccessible, atheoretical, or otherwise limiting. This article reflects on this state of the field. Then it discusses the motivation, experience, and outcomes of developing OSMnx, a tool intended to help address this. Next it reviews this tool's use in the recent multidisciplinary spatial network science literature to highlight upstream and downstream benefits of open-source software development. Tool-building is an essential but poorly incentivized component of academic geography and social science more broadly. To conduct better science, we need to build better tools.

We discuss a reconciliation for various disparate claims and results in the literature that stand in the way of a unified description and understanding of human wars and conflicts. We also discuss the unified interpretation of the origin of these power-law deviations in terms of dynamical processes.

A possible way out is that social sciences collaborate with computational or data scientists in interdisciplinary research projects to rely on each other’s skills and to develop jointly accepted ethical principles. In this exploratory study, we collected data from researchers with a variety of academic backgrounds to find out their views of interdisciplinary projects and related methodological or ethical issues. Our findings derived from one-on-one interviews (n = 22) reinforce the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration and highlight the significance of “interpreters,” i.e., individuals able to communicate with and connect various areas of science, education, and academic institutions’ role in enhancing interdisciplinary collaborations of sciences. Additional concerns of participants emerged in terms of research methodology applied in the digital world (i.e., data validity, credibility and research ethics). Finally, participants identified open science and the transparency of research as the key to the future development of social sciences. © 2021 The Author(s).

Remediation is associated with significant economic and social costs while the results are usually dubious. In this paper, we apply a widely used method called Regression Discontinuity Design (RDD) to measure the effectiveness of two differently designed remedial mathematics courses at the Budapest University of Technology and Economics. Our large-scale study is based on data of almost 20,000 undergraduate students enrolled between 2010 and 2018. Using modern RDD tools in various settings, we study both the direct and longer-term effects of remediation; and find that the design of the remedial course matters a lot. We measured a statistically significant positive effect on subsequent academic achievement for both course designs; however, the magnitude of the effect differs substantially. We measured a higher effect for the remedial course that serves as an extra practice class for the university level calculus course than for traditional remediation. As a methodological novelty, we propose a novel alternative method to handle discrete running variable in the RDD setting. We also provide some suggestions on how to improve mathematical remediation using personalized e-learning systems.

Simultaneously, real-world disparities continue to exist, even before algorithmic decisions are made. In this work, we draw on insights from the social sciences brought into the realm of causal modeling and constrained optimization, and develop a novel algorithmic framework for tackling pre-existing real-world disparities. The purpose of our framework, which we call the ""impact remediation framework,""is to measure real-world disparities and discover the optimal intervention policies that could help improve equity or access to opportunity for those who are underserved with respect to an outcome of interest. We develop a disaggregated approach to tackling pre-existing disparities that relaxes the typical set of assumptions required for the use of social categories in structural causal models. Our approach flexibly incorporates counterfactuals and is compatible with various ontological assumptions about the nature of social categories. We demonstrate impact remediation with a hypothetical case study and compare our disaggregated approach to an existing state-of-the-art approach, comparing its structure and resulting policy recommendations. In contrast to most work on optimal policy learning, we explore disparity reduction itself as an objective, explicitly focusing the power of algorithms on reducing inequality.  © 2021 ACM.",causal modeling; fairness; inequality; social categories,Pollution; Algorithmic framework; Algorithmics; Causal modeling; Counterfactuals; Fairness; Inequality; Optimal intervention; Real-world; Social categories; Typical sets; Constrained optimization,English,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus

Massive check-in data generated by LBSNs can be employed to explore users' behavior preferences, and enable a wide range of location-based social services. The most straightforward service is Point of Interest (POI) recommendation, which help users to discover their desired places. In order to achieve effective and precise POI recommendation, complicated high-dimensional data need to be handled, i.e., user-geographical position-visiting time-category of the visiting place. Besides, such data usually suffer from a data sparsity problem. To this end, this paper proposes a novel POI recommendation model that incorporates spatial and temporal preferences of the users. We propose a tensor factorization-based approach and a Voronoi diagram-based approach to model the impact of temporal and spatial features on users' preference, respectively. Then, a fusion framework is proposed to calculate similarities between different uses by combining both temporal and spatial preferences of the users. Finally, an adaptive collaborative filtering approach is applied to generate recommendation list.

Generally, a representation of a network object is learned in a Euclidean geometry and is then used for subsequent tasks regarding the nodes and/or edges of the network, such as community detection, node classification and link prediction. Network embedding algorithms have been proposed in multiple disciplines, often with domain-specific notations and details. In addition, different measures and tools have been adopted to evaluate and compare the methods proposed under different settings, often dependent of the downstream tasks. As a result, it is challenging to study these algorithms in the literature systematically. Motivated by the recently proposed PCS framework for Veridical Data Science, we propose a framework for network embedding algorithms and discuss how the principles of predictability, computability, and stability (PCS) apply in this context. The utilization of this framework in network embedding holds the potential to motivate and point to new directions for future research. © 2020 Wiley Periodicals LLC",feature engineering; latent variable models; network embedding; representational learning; veridical data science,Data Science; Community detection; Domain specific; Euclidean Geometry; Link prediction; Multiple disciplines; Network embedding; Network objects; Statistical machine learning; Embeddings,English,Review,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus

To address the after-mentioned needs, this paper proposes a possible approach named social pal. The social pal collects and provides the information to the IoT, and hence our proposed social network provides glue to allow the human to device interaction. This study leverages the social relationships among the participants (devices and users) in the system for delivering the required services to the users. By using this platform the capability to select and find the devices, discover the services in the IoT paradigm is augmented.

While many shared value propositions exist regarding what these technologies afford, public-facing concerns related to individual privacy, algorithm fairness, and the access to insights requires attention if the widespread use and subsequent value of these technologies are to be fully realized. Drawing from perspectives of data science, social science and technology acceptance, we present an interdisciplinary analysis that links these concerns with traditional research and development (R&D) activities. We suggest a reframing of the public R&D ‘brand’ that responds to legitimate concerns related to data collection, development, and the implementation of big data technologies.

This is the possibility of sophisticated studies combined with remedial understanding. Analytics for intelligent systems should cover architecture of hardware platforms and application of software methods, technique and tools. It is anticipated that adapting dynamic memory information, processing parametric values of large data sheets with optimization, would be faster. The field of Big-Data Analytics under recent trends of Data Science studies various means of pre-processing, analyzing and filtering from huge and semi-structured data sets from different sources which are complex to be handled by traditional data processing systems. In addition to extracting and aggregating data from various main performance measures, this proposal also forecasts potential values for these KPIs (Key Performance Indicators) and alerts them when unfavorable values are about to occur. As AI and ML are implemented through different platforms and sectors including chat-bots, robotics, social media, healthcare, self-driven automobile and space exploration, large companies are investing in these fields, and the demand for ML and AI experts is growing accordingly. Python is becoming the most popular language for AI (Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning) due to its rich supported tools.

Biomechanical stressors do not have a major pathogenic role, but psychosocial predisposition is important. The occurrence and progression of CLBP are significantly affected by psychosocial risk factors. Guidelines recommend the early identification of psychosocial factors that could predict CLBP. Aim: To determine the prevalence and psychosocial risk factors for CLBP amongst adults in KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa. Setting: The study was conducted at five randomly selected public hospitals in KwaZulu-Natal. Methods: Analytical cross-sectional hospital-based study utilising a self-administered questionnaire to collect data on (1) sociodemographic, (2) disability, (3) fear-avoidance beliefs and (4) illness behaviour. The Statistical Package for the Social Sciences (SPSS) 24.0 was used for data cleaning and descriptive statistics. Chi-square test was used for categorical variables. Standard Edition of the Statistical Software for Data Science version 17.0 (STATA 17.0 SE) was used to identify risk factors using the logistic regression analysis. A />-value of < 0.05 was deemed statistically significant. Results: Overall prevalence of CLBP was 22.2% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 18.8-25.9). Females had a higher prevalence of CLBP than males, 23.9% (95% CI: 19.4-28.9) and 19.7% (95% CI: 14.8-25.5), respectively; however, the difference was not significant p = 0.243. The multivariate regression analysis identified the following risk factors: female gender, middleaged adults 38-47 years, obesity, disease conviction, affective disturbance, denial and fearavoidance behaviour-work subscale. Conclusion: There is a high prevalence of CLBP amongst the study participants. Psychosocial factors (disease conviction, affective disturbance and fear-avoidance behaviour about work) are significant predictors of CLBP. © 2022. The Authors. Licensee: AOSIS.

To achieve this goal, images extracted from digital footprints of users are used. The proposed new approach compares not only the main images of a user’s profile, but also all the elements of the graphic content published in a user’s account. The described approach requires a pairwise comparison of the images published by users in two accounts from different online social networks on the “all-to-all” principle to assess the probability that these accounts belong to the same user. The comparison of the labeled graphical content elements is performed using the well-known perceptual hash method called pHash. A computational experiment was conducted to evaluate the results obtained by using the proposed approach, the f1-score achieved 0.886 for three matched images. It is shown that the results of the pHash image comparison can be used for account identification as a standalone approach as well as to complement other identification approaches. The proposed algorithm can be used to supplement the existing methods for comparative analysis of accounts. Automation of the proposed approach provides a tool for aggregation and makes it possible to obtain more information about users, assessing the depth of their personality features. The results can be applied to forming a digital twin of the user for further description of his (or her) traits in the tasks of protection against social engineering attacks, targeted advertising, assessment of creditworthiness, and other studies related to online social networks and social sciences. © 2021, ITMO University.

A contributing factor may be the statistical software that is used, as the design of such software may not address the needs of non-statisticians or non-computer programming students. Hence, decisions about which statistical software tools are most suitable for such end-users need to be made at the introductory level. This paper first identifies key human-computer interaction (HCI) factors that may directly influence students' statistical analysis performance. Factors include technical properties such as user interface design, statistical features available, visualization, data handling, preparation, and manipulation, and usage properties such as speed/number of steps, ease of command/use, and efficiency. Four popular software systems (ie, SPSS, R within RStudio Desktop, R Commander & jamovi) were evaluated. Findings suggest that HCI usage factors from an interaction perspective are likely to be especially important for students gaining an introductory knowledge of statistics. © 2021 Teaching Statistics Trust.",evaluation; human-computer interaction features; introductory data science and statistics; research students in the social sciences; statistical software tools; teaching,,English,Article,Final,,Scopus

Yet all too often the assumptions and premises underlying data analysis remain unexamined, even in contemporary debates about the fairness of algorithmic systems. This blindspot exists in part because the methodological toolkit used to evaluate the fairness of algorithmic systems remains limited to a narrow set of computational and legal modes of analysis. In this paper, we expand on Elish and Boyd's [17] call for data scientists to develop more robust frameworks for understanding their work as situated practice by examining a specific methodological debate within the field of anthropology, frequently referred to as the practice of ""studying up"". We reflect on the contributions that the call to ""study up"" has made in the field of anthropology before making the case that the field of algorithmic fairness would similarly benefit from a reorientation ""upward"". A case study from our own work illustrates what it looks like to reorient one's research questions ""up"" in a high-profile debate regarding the fairness of an algorithmic system - namely, pretrial risk assessment in American criminal law. We discuss the limitations of contemporary fairness discourse with regard to pretrial risk assessment before highlighting the insights gained when we reframe our research questions to focus on those who inhabit positions of power and authority within the U.S. court system. Finally, we reflect on the challenges we have encountered in implementing data science projects that ""study up"". In the process, we surface new insights and questions about what it means to ethically engage in data science work that directly confronts issues of power and authority. © 2020 Association for Computing Machinery.",,Computation theory; Data Science; Transparency; Court systems; Criminal laws; Research questions; Science projects; Social norm; Sociotechnical; Risk assessment,English,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus

Since the time of Nixon, the republicans have initialized the 'southern strategy' to absorb the votes of the white majority in the southern states. This strategy was considered to be the most successful strategy in history of modern politics by Cornell Belcher [1]. Following the same pattern, Ronald Reagan and George H.W. Bush were successfully get elected and the Donald Trump is not an exception therefore, from Nixon to Trump, it can be seen that this strategy, which represented the interest of the white majority, has gradually been weakened. In contrast, the identity politics of Democrats party started to sway the power even in some southern states and gradually dominated the recent popular votes. Since two parties both have their strategies when it comes to the identity politics, the change of population structure will be significant in predicting the politics trend, which is the purpose of this essay. That is to use the simple formula, the linear regression, to predict the demographics in different states, reflecting the American politics in the future. It turns out that if the republican party insists on using the 'southern strategy' and assume that these two parties will not alter their policy in the future, the states voting for the republican will continuously 'shrink' into the inlands, where the white population are still increasing and hardly have minority immigrations. Most states either near the coastline or near the border of Mexico will start to turn blue (the symbol of democratic party) and Texas, the base of republicans, is not an exception, which signals that the republican should try to absorb at least one minority race as soon as possible.  © 2020 IEEE.",data science; Demography; political science; social science; statistics,Behavioral research; Big data; Population statistics; Electoral map; Me-xico; Popular vote; Population structures; Southern state; Forecasting,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus

E-Shopping is rapidly growing during the last decade simply because people are able to purchase items from these online platforms 24x7. Online shopping is a process where consumers buy goods and services from a shop or a seller over the internet. Popular websites like AlieExpress, eBay are good examples of that. Presently this Online-shopping concept is also very popular in Sri Lanka. In this research, the authors mainly concentrate on the Sri Lankan Online Clothing stores and try to examine the online consumers buying behavior based on ethnicity. The authors chose Sri Lanka since Sri Lanka is a multi-ethnic country. There are mainly four ethnicities live in Sri Lanka. They are Sinhalese, Tamils, Muslims, and Burghers. For this research mainly Sinhalese and Tamils, the two main ethnicities are considered. In this research, the study authors analyze the buying behavior of those two ethnicities such as cloth types, favorite colors in online clothing shopping platforms. Moreover, in this research, authors implement classification models that can predict the cloth type and the color of the clothes based on consumers' ethnicities. The main benefit of this research would go to Sri Lankan online sellers. They would be able to get a clear understanding of the buying behaviors and the expectations of the consumers based on their ethnicities. Moreover, from this, sellers could improve their sales and online shopping users can get an attractive and good online shopping experience.  © 2021 ACM.",Big data; Buying behavior; Classification; Data Science; Social Science,Classification (of information); Consumer behavior; Data Science; Electronic commerce; Behavior analysis; Behavior prediction; Buying behavior; Consumer buying; Good and services; Online platforms; Online shopping; Social science; Sri Lanka; Time-to-go; Big data,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus

Examples include Canada in the Americas, Singapore in Asia, and Switzerland in Europe. With the initiatives of globalization, many people immigrate or live in a country other than their birthplace. As a result, different people in the same country may have different home language (i.e., first language). For instance, as a nation composed of a highly diverse language population, Canada provides a unique opportunity to study the factors causing certain languages (or families of language) to be lost over subsequent generations among allophones (i.e., people whose mother tongue is neither English or French). In this paper, we focus on census data analytics. Specifically, we analyze census microdata by exploring machine learning and data mining techniques-such as decision tree induction, random forest, and categorical naive Bayes-to study the influence of various social and economic factors on the probability that allophones adopt official languages as their language spoken at home.

It filters appropriate information for user decisions. The most popular approaches of recommendation systems are content-based and collaborative filtering-based, which are created as a model by using user preferences and providing recommendations. Additionally, the hybrid approach is proposed to improve recommendations typically by combining the advantages of two techniques to increase efficiency and prediction performance. However, general recommendation systems typically abandon users' contextual preferences such as culture, emotions, and other details in different situations. Researchers are attempting to apply knowledge from other scientific fields to improve the performance of their recommendation systems. Psychology is one of approaches that can be applied to understand and explain humanity and shows that emotions influence decision-driven, efficient, and predictable. This paper reviews relevant research analyzes state-of-arts, gaps, and further recommendation system research based on emotion. We find that most of the selected research use sentiment data extracted from open data sources and social networks.

Many universities and colleges offer a neuroscience major that may or may not add additional mathematics, statistics, or data science requirements. Today in the age of Big Data and Systems Neuroscience, many students are ill-equipped for the future without the tools of computational competency that are necessary to tackle the large data sets generated by contemporary neuroscience research. Required courses in statistics still focus on parametric statistics based on the normal distribution and do not provide the computational tools required to analyze big data sets. Undergraduates in STEM fields including neuroscience need to enroll in the Data Science courses that are required in the social sciences (e.g., economics, political science and psychology). Contemporary systems neuroscience is routinely done by interdisciplinary research teams of statisticians, engineers, and physical scientists. Emerging “NeuroX-omics” such as connectomics have emerged along with genomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics, all of which deploy systems analysis techniques based on mathematical graph theory. Connectomics is the 21st Century's functional neuroanatomy. Whole brain connectome research appears almost monthly in the Drosphila, zebra fish, and mouse literature, and human brain connectomics is not far behind. The techniques for connectomics rely on the tools of data science. Undergraduate neuroscience students are already squeezed for credit hours given the high-prescribed science curriculum for biology majors and premedical students, in addition to required courses in social sciences and humanities. However, additional training in mathematics, statistics, computer science, and/or data science is urgently needed for undergraduate neuroscience majors just to understand the contemporary research literature. Undoubtedly, the faculty who teach neuroscience courses are acutely aware of the problem and most of them freely acknowledge the importance of quantitative analytical skills for their students. However, some faculty members may feel that their own math and statistics knowledge or other analytical skills have atrophied beyond recall or were never fulfilled in the first place. In this commentary I suggest that this problem can be ameliorated, though not solved, through organizing workshops, journal clubs, or independent studies courses in which the students and the instructors learn and teach each other in short-course format. In addition, web-available teaching materials such as targeted video clips are plentifully available on the internet. To attract and maintain student interest, qauntitative instruction and learning should occur in neuroscience context. © 2021",Big data in neuroscience; Biopsychology; Coding; Data science; Neuroscience Major; Neuroscience minor; Python; R; Undergraduate neuroscience education; Workshops,Big Data; Humans; Neurosciences; Article; big data; biology; college; data analysis; data science; human; learning; mathematics; neuroscience; nonhuman; skill; statistics; undergraduate education; university; workshop; education; neuroscience,English,Article,Final,,Scopus

Our interactions with the phone network can take several forms, from SMS messages to phone calls and data usage. Typically, mobile phone data are released to researchers in the form of call detail records, which contain records of different types of interactions, and can be used to analyse various aspects of our behaviour. However, the inherently behavioural nature of these interactions may result in differences between how we make phone calls and receive text messages. Studies which rely on data derived from these interactions, therefore, need to carefully consider these differences. Here, we aim to investigate differences and limitations of different types of mobile phone interactions data by analysing a large mobile phone dataset. We study the relationship between different types of interactions and show how it changes over time.

Shortly after the American Society of Animal Science (ASAS) centennial, we conducted a national survey of 90 faculty instructors from 49 academic institutions to assess their perceptions of emerging teaching topics. Participants rated 18 learning outcomes (LO) and 16 types of courses and experiences (CE) with respect to their importance and the adequacy of available offerings. This study presents the results of the survey along with a scoping review of animal sciences teaching and learning publications since 2008 (n = 71). Results indicated that discipline-specific competencies and core experiential learning remain central to animal sciences teaching and identified several distinct needs for research. Namely, we suggest that future research in animal sciences teaching and learning 1) develop animal-science-specific expertise on a greater variety of pedagogies, 2) validate improved methods for assessing transferable skills, 3) expand pedagogical knowledge of emerging topics (e.g., sustainability, data science, welfare science, social science), and 4) deepen and broaden animal sciences' teaching and learning identity through theory-building work and collaborations across instructors, disciplines, and institutions.  © 2020 The Author(s).

However, most smaller schools are currently facing challenges to provide related knowledge and skill to a broad student population. During Spring of 2019, we organized a faculty workshop on Data Science Pedagogy and Practice aimed at building and enhancing data science capacity (teaching, research, partnership, collaboration) at our institution. We gathered faculty input on what would be needed for a successful university-wide initiative to incorporate data analytics concepts as a basic component of training across variety of disciplines including science, business and social sciences. We were able to identify certain challenges and opportunities to accommodate deeper coverage of data science in the undergraduate teaching and research, and as a result, we initiated few efforts such as 1) teaching through faculty partnership, 2) module-based integration into existing courses rather than developing new courses, 3) development of reusable course modules and augment that with contextual hand-on projects so that students could appreciate the use of data science in their own career path, 4) facilitation of course preparation and implementation via a small faculty adopter grant, and 5) development of a graduate certificate program in data analytics.

Analyzing this data, we investigated gender bias in on-screen female characters over the past century. We find a trend of improvement in all aspects of women‘s roles in movies, including a constant rise in the centrality of female characters. There has also been an increase in the number of movies that pass the well-known Bechdel test, a popular—albeit flawed—measure of women in fiction. Here we propose a new and better alternative to this test for evaluating female roles in movies.

Growing such a workforce is critical to ensuring the nation's competitiveness, according to a recent National Science Board publication. To address this need, faculty from the Colleges of Engineering and Social Sciences at San Jose State University worked together to create the Applied Computing for Behavioral and Social Sciences minor degree. The minor targets students in majors such as Psychology and Economics, which have a more diverse student population than that of Computer Science or Engineering. The minor, designed with industry input, includes a four-course sequence that focuses on Python and R and includes topics such as data structures, algorithms, data cleaning and management, and data analysis. Our cohort-based program was built specifically for social science students using social science content, helping to foster a sense of community and belongingness among students. The first full cohort of 26 students graduated in Spring 2019, 48% of whom were female and 23% of whom were underrepresented minorities.

Due to the prevalent techniques like Internet of Things (IoT), Fog/Edge computing and the vast use of social networking, there is a significant increase in the generation of network traffic data. For this reason, proper and fast mechanisms are needed to monitorvariety of data to fight against the vulnerabilities and threats those may occur in the system. In the present article, a machine learning based Intrusion Detection Scheme (IDS) is being proposed. This system can monitor and analyze the incoming network traffic whether is normal. UNSW-NB 15 dataset is used to validate the machine learning model which is powered by boosting algorithm.Three of the boosting algorithms such as Adaptive Boosting (AdaBoost), Extreme Gradient Boosting (XGBoost) and Gradient Boosting Classifier (GBC) are trained over the six baseline models such as Support Vector Machine (SVM), Decision Tree (DT), K-Nearest Neighborhood (KNN), two variants of Random Forest Model, Gaussian Naïve Bayes (GNB). The performance of the IDS is measured in terms of correct analysis of the network traffic as normal or abnormal and the time taken to detect it. As per the observed results the proposed IDS system is providing the best results for X G B model which gives 95.57 % of accuracy and the time taken to do it is come out as 3.03 seconds.

Surprisingly, far fewer neuroscientific articles have been published in this field of research and one might well ask whether the cognitive neurosciences have anything to say at all about this vital topic. In this article, we highlight a research perspective relating to differences in the individual perception of the pandemic in Western compared to Eastern countries. Although this problem is complex, multifaceted and subsumes many other social variables, we suggest that the cognitive neurosciences do have important and fundamental insights to contribute concerning the collective response observed within these populations. More precisely, we propose the hypothesis that differences in the propensity to adopt a holistic perception of contamination processes at the group level, involving brain structures that are also associated with perspective-taking and empathy such as, in particular, the medial prefrontal cortex (MPFC) and the anterior cingulate cortex (ACC), could help explain the differences in the perception of the pandemic observed between Western and Eastern countries. © Copyright © 2021 Mermillod and Morisseau.",cognitive neuroscience; COVID-19; intercultural psychology; pandemics; perspective-taking; SARS-CoV-2; social neurosciences,anterior cingulate; Article; cognitive neuroscience; comparative study; coronavirus disease 2019; Eastern Hemisphere; empathy; human; medial prefrontal cortex; mental disease; mortality rate; pandemic; perception; psychological aspect; social aspect; Western Hemisphere,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus

World Wide Web and social networks are examples of these big data. They have become a vast data production and consumption platform, at which threads of data evolve from multiple devices, by different human interactions, over worldwide locations, under divergent distributed settings. Embedded in these big web data is implicit, previously unknown and potentially useful information and knowledge that awaited to be discovered. This calls for web intelligence solutions, which make good use of data science, data mining (especially, web mining) and social network analysis to discover useful knowledge and important information from the web (e.g., web of people/things). Such a web often consists of vertices (i.e., people/things) and edges (i.e., connections among people/things). When modeling a social network as a web of people, these edges can be undirected (e.g., for mutual friendships) or directed (e.g., for capturing a social entity who is following another social entity). In this paper, we present a web intelligence solution to discover interesting knowledge (e.g., most-followed people or most-referenced web pages) from these social connections. Due to the dynamic nature of the web, vertices and/or edges may be changed (e.g., added or deleted) over time. Hence, our solution is designed in such a way that it discovers knowledge not only from a static web but also from a dynamic web. Evaluation on real-life web data demonstrates the effectiveness and practicality of our solution for discovering knowledge and supporting recommendations from the web.  © 2021 ACM.",Data analytics; Data mining; Data science; Directed graphs; Frequent pattern mining; Friend recommendation; Graph theory; Intelligent agent technology; Linear algebra; Market basket analysis; Product recommendation; Recommendation; Social network analysis; Web intelligence; Web mining; Web of people; Web structure mining; Web usage mining; World wide web,Big data; Data Analytics; Data Science; Directed graphs; Graph Databases; Graph neural networks; Linear algebra; Social networking (online); Social sciences computing; Websites; Data analytics; Frequent patterns minings; Friend recommendations; Intelligent agent technology; Market basket analysis; Product recommendation; Recommendation; Social Network Analysis; Web intelligence; Web Mining; Web of people; Web structure mining; Web usage mining; Data mining,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus

Identifying influencers is an interesting topic in social networks, and centrality measures are among the methods used to address this topic. Each measure has some shortcomings. In this paper, we gather centrality measures by using Technology for Order Preference by Similarity to an Ideal Solution (TOPSIS) method, which is a Multi-Criteria Decision Making (MCDM) to identify potential influences in a social network. A case study is presented to explain carefully TOPSIS and to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method, three real datasets are used for the experiments.

Data science applies database techniques, scientific and engineering methods, mathematical and statistical models, data mining algorithms, and/or machine learning tools to manage data, extract the useful information and discover the new knowledge from these big data. This explains why data science for big data applications and services has become a fundamental technology in providing novel solutions in various areas in business, engineering, health, humanities, natural sciences, social sciences, etc. (e.g., healthcare, manufacturing, social life). Usually, data science focuses on big data management, analytics and visualization. Once big data are managed (i.e., captured, curated, managed and processed), big data are analyzed with an aim to discover interesting knowledge and information, which is usually presented in text or table form. Consistent with a proverb that “a picture is worth a thousand words”, big data visualization as well as visual analytics helps to reveal and explain the discovered interesting knowledge and information. In this paper, we present (a) big data management with focus on information fusion and the data lake; (b) big data analytics and mining, with focus on frequent patterns; as well as (c) big data visualization with focus on a few visual analytic systems for visualizing big data and mined frequent patterns.

FPGAs as accelerators for graph processing with a customizable memory hierarchy promise solving performance problems caused by inherent irregular memory access patterns on traditional hardware (e. g., CPU). However, developing such hardware accelerators is yet timeconsuming and difficult and benchmarking is non-standardized, hindering comprehension of the impact of memory access pattern changes and systematic engineering of graph processing accelerators. In this work, we propose a simulation environment for the analysis of graph processing accelerators based on simulating their memory access patterns. Further, we evaluate our approach on two state-ofthe- art FPGA graph processing accelerators and show reproducibility, comparablity, as well as the shortened development process by an example. Not implementing the cycle-accurate internal data flow on accelerator hardware like FPGAs significantly reduces the implementation time, increases the benchmark parameter transparency, and allows comparison of graph processing approaches. © 2021 Gesellschaft fur Informatik (GI).

The book will be an invaluable reference for scholars who routinely engage in critical sociological analysis of the digital workplace and find it easier to treat the digital as an object of study. It describes how the transformations taking place in the 10-year arc of a career spent doing fieldwork in the IT sector led the author to progressively embrace new forms of data and methods. In a time where sociological imagination takes the shape of whatever new phenomenon can be studied by transactional data and machine learning methods, it is a reminder that longstanding engagement with a particular field of practice is the basis of empirical social science expertise. 'This short book by Gian Marco Campagnolo is remarkably wide-ranging. It draws on theoretical perspectives as varied as Harold Garfinkel's ethnomethodology and Andrew Abbott's 'linked ecologies' to discuss topics as diverse as the adoption of packaged enterprise software in the public sector in Italy and the careers of often influential industry analysts. Campagnolo's methods are primarily qualitative and ethnographic, but he shows a proper appreciation for quantitative methods such as text mining and sequence analysis. The book ends with a discussion of the famously difficult issue of achieving 'explainability' in machine learning. Campagnolo tantalisingly suggests the usefulness here of how ethnomethodologists view 'accountability': as a practical accomplishment that is hampered, rather than fostered, by efforts to give full explanations.' -Donald MacKenzie, Professor of Sociology, Edinburgh University, Scotland 'The author adopts a 'processual' perspective on social data science as means of exploring and reflecting on the emergence of an academic career within this new domain of interdisciplinary inquiry. This is certainly a novel and interesting approach given the fact that 'data science' is work in progress and is characterized by a number of competing occupational groups that are struggling to define this emerging field.'-William Housley, Professor, University of Cardiff, UK 'Having myself written about the relationships between ethnography and computer science, I see this book as a timely contribution in that it extends the existing debate to data science. Data science is an emerging discipline that is gaining central stage in industry and in the public discourse. The aim of this book to indicate the importance of interdisciplinarity in this field is commendable.' -Giolo Fele, Professor, University of Trento, Italy 'This book provides two entwined accounts: a reflective personal journey across different projects and methods and a grounded, genealogically sound analysis of the approaches and contributions of social science to understanding the digital society. These dual accounts are adroitly communicated. Their bold combination yields a unique and invaluable contribution to fundamental discussions in the social sciences, as well as an exemplar for how to combine ethnographic and data-driven analysis in a theoretically and epistemologically informed manner. With this book, Campagnolo brings us close to the methods and opens up an inspiring and challenging agenda for combining old and new forms of inquiry into sociological problems.' -Anne Beaulieu, Director Data Research Centre, University of Groningen, Netherlands. © The Editor(s) (if applicable) and The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Nature Switzerland AG 2020.

Innovation, computation, and technological advances have now tremendously accelerated the pace of discovery, providing driverless cars, robotic devices, expert healthcare systems, precision medicine, and automated discovery to mention a few. Even though the definition of the term data science continues to evolve, the sweeping impact it has already produced on society is undeniable. We are at a point when new discoveries through data science have enormous potential to advance progress but also to be used maliciously, with harmful ethical and social consequences. Perhaps nowhere is this more clearly exemplified than in the biological and medical sciences. The confluence of (1) machine learning, (2) mathematical modeling, (3) computation/simulation, and (4) big data have moved us from the sequencing of genomes to gene editing and individualized medicine; yet, unsettled policies regarding data privacy and ethical norms could potentially open doors for serious negative repercussions. The data science revolution has amplified the urgent need for a paradigm shift in undergraduate biology education. It has reaffirmed that data science education interacts and enhances mathematical education in advancing quantitative conceptual and skill development for the new generation of biologists. These connections encourage us to strive to cultivate a broadly skilled workforce of technologically savvy problem-solvers, skilled at handling the unique challenges pertaining to biological data, and capable of collaborating across various disciplines in the sciences, the humanities, and the social sciences. To accomplish this, we suggest development of open curricula that extend beyond the job certification rhetoric and combine data acumen with modeling, experimental, and computational methods through engaging projects, while also providing awareness and deep exploration of their societal implications. This process would benefit from embracing the pedagogy of experiential learning and involve students in open-ended explorations derived from authentic inquiries and ongoing research. On this foundation, we encourage development of flexible data science initiatives for the education of life science undergraduates within and across existing models. © 2020, Society for Mathematical Biology.",Big data; Data science education; Education reform; Mathematical biology education,Computational Biology; Curriculum; Data Science; Humans; biology; curriculum; education; human,English,Article,Final,,Scopus

The Quarterly Report on Household Debt and Credit released in May of 2018 shows that among all debt balances, student loans remain the only form of debt that virtually sextupled over the last 15-years, and this trend is not slowing down. Although aggregated trends are important, by definition they are limited in their capabilities to providing researchers, policy- and decision-makers with insights related to individual debt accumulation and, perhaps more importantly, with knowledge about the factors associated with variation of individual debt burden. Accordingly, the overarching goal of this study is to ameliorate this limitation in three meaningful ways. First, this is the first study that offers inferential estimates of the magnitude of student debt accumulation increase across two different decades (1991–2013) and institutional sectors (public 2- and 4-year colleges). Second, these estimates are based on student level undergraduate non-self-reported longitudinal loan debt disbursements. Third, the estimates not only account for individuals’ baseline differences at the moment of college entry, but also account for institution- and state-level indicators that took place during college enrollment and that may be related to the variation of student loan debt reliance. Two nationally representative samples (NELS and ELS) complemented with other institution- and state-level data were analyzed using doubly robust estimators build from propensity score weights and entropy balancing approaches that were robust to unobservable selection issues using Oster’s approach (J Bus Econ Stat 37(2):1–18, 2017). The results consistently indicated that, among all participants, student borrowing participation increased by 15 percentage points in the 2000s, compared to the 1990s, and individual debt accumulation at least doubled across decades. Notably, among 4-year degree holders, the 2-year path toward a 4-year degree consistently resulted in about 10% lower debt accumulation compared to the 4-year path toward a 4-year degree. Students who did not attain a 4-year degree were better served by having started college in the 2-year sector. In terms of overall debt increase, 4-year degree holders accrued about $8000 more on average than their counterparts did during the 1990s, however, the recent cohort also repaid about $11,000 more, on average (or three times as much), than participants did in the 1990s. These higher repayment behaviors observed among 4-year degree holders, resulted in similar amounts of their respective debt balances across decades. The implications are clear: students with higher propensities toward a 4-year degree attainment are likely to incur lower debt if they start college in the community college sector. However, before fully recommending this pathway, 2- and 4-year colleges’ articulation agreements should be strengthened to ease transfer and eventual degree completion. Without recommending consolidation or merger between 2- and 4-year institutions, researchers and policy makers can learn from the strategies implemented by successful cases such as Perimeter College and Georgia State. Finally, 4-year entrants with lower likelihood to attain a 4-year degree may be better served by beginning college in the 2-year sector instead. Predictive analytics and machine learning techniques can be used to identify these cases, as depicted in the discussion section of the study. © 2019, Springer Nature B.V.",Community college effects on student loan debt; Data science; Doubly-robust modeling; Entropy balancing; Higher education finance and college choice; Machine learning; Philosophy of Causation in the social sciences; Predictive analytics; Propensity score weighting; Quasi-causal estimates; Unobservable selection and Coefficient stability,,English,Article,Final,,Scopus

Three particular aspects are behind this leap forward: A generalized availability and variety of data; a deeper understanding of the mathematics governing the underlying algorithmics; and hardware capabilities allowing wide and deep experimental pipelines over data. The main challenge in each problem and context of application now lies on understanding how can these technologies can be used, their reach and limitations so that the can be aligned with the aims of each specific problem at hand.

We develop three computational formulations of textual coherence drawing upon the state-of-the-art methods in natural language processing and data science. Two real-world datasets from widely different domains which have fake/legitimate article labellings are then analyzed with respect to textual coherence. We observe apparent differences in textual coherence across fake and legitimate news articles, with fake news articles consistently scoring lower on coherence as compared to legitimate news ones. While the relative coherence shortfall of fake news articles as compared to legitimate ones form the main observation from our study, we analyze several aspects of the differences and outline potential avenues of further inquiry. © 2020, The Author(s).",,Data handling; Data mining; Data Science; Machine learning; Computational formulations; Computational social science; Different domains; NAtural language processing; News articles; Online media; Real-world datasets; State-of-the-art methods; Natural language processing systems,English,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus

This article opens with a critical review of the literature on data collection and analysis, and summarizes current ethical discussions focusing on these technologies. A semiotic model of data production and circulation is then introduced to problematize the view that digital data has ceased to stand for a formalization method (a possible kind of representation among others), and effectively ""becomes the world itself"" (a direct presentation of the world outperforming all other modes of representation). Following Charles Sanders Peirce's semiotics and pragmaticist philosophy, we characterize digitalization as a hypersymbolic semiotic process, and we highlight the naturalization of meaning, the illusion of iconicity, and rhetorical efficiency on which data's truth value relies within the context of its large-scale, profit-driven, and results-oriented research uses. This outlines some epistemological and ethical implications of data's visualization, use, and authority, and indicates avenues for critical semiotics of contemporary data science and analysis. © 2019 Walter de Gruyter GmbH, Berlin/Boston 2019.","data science, C.

The selection processes underlying a conclusion often become black-boxed. Thus, the decision flow is not always comprehensible by developers or end users. It is unclear what the priorities are and whether all of the relevant information is used. In order to achieve human interpretability of the created algorithms, it is recommended to include domain experts in the modelling phase. Their knowledge is elicited through a combination of machine learning and social science techniques. The idea is not new, but it remains a challenge to extract and apply the experts’ experience without overburdening them. The current paper describes a methodology set to unravel, define and categorize the implicit and explicit domain knowledge in a less intense way by making use of co-creation to design human-centered algorithms, when little data is available. The methodology is applied to a case in the health domain, targeting a rheumatology triage problem. The domain knowledge is obtained through dialogue, by alternating workshops and data science exercises. © IFIP International Federation for Information Processing 2019.",Decision support systems; Human-centered algorithms; Knowledge elicitation methods; Knowledge engineering,Artificial intelligence; Decision support systems; Knowledge engineering; Learning algorithms; Co-creation; Domain experts; Domain knowledge; End users; Interpretability; Machine learning techniques; Learning systems,English,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus

These social media platforms now offer vast amounts of data to perform analyses that correlate online data with real-world phenomena. These correlations have potential applications in not only many parallel aspects of data science but also in social sciences that study human behavior online. This paper conducts a comparative analysis amongst various machine learning algorithms by correlating Twitter text data and weather. These algorithms process tweet data to infer the type of weather. This paper details the implementations, conceptual structures, and advantages and disadvantages of these algorithms. It was determined that the multilayer perceptrons and the naive Bayes classifier were unable to find any significant correlations, and achieved accuracies similar to guessing. On the contrary, both the convolutional and recurrent neural networks reached categorization accuracies well above the baseline test, demonstrating the benefit of considering context and groups of tweets at a time and indicating that there exists some correlation between weather and tweet text data. Ultimately, the recurrent network performed best with a maximum validation accuracy of 65.7%.  © 2019 IEEE.",convolutional neural network; epoch; hidden layers; multilayer perceptron; nodes; overfitting; recurrent neural network; ReLU; sigmoid; softmax,Behavioral research; Classifiers; Convolution; Learning algorithms; Recurrent neural networks; Social networking (online); Convolutional neural network; Epoch; Hidden layers; Multilayers perceptrons; Node; Overfitting; ReLU; Sigmoids; Softmax; Text data; Multilayer neural networks,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus

For network sciences, for example, in social sciences, computer science and data science, only a few small-scale studies of the symmetry of complex real-world graphs exist. Graph symmetry is a topic rooted in mathematics and is not yet well-received and applied in practice. This article underlines the importance of analyzing symmetry by showing the existence of symmetry in real-world graphs. An analysis of over 1500 graph datasets from the meta-repository networkrepository.com is carried out and a normalized version of the ""network redundancy"" measure is presented. It quantifies graph symmetry in terms of the number of orbits of the symmetry group from zero (no symmetries) to one (completely symmetric), and improves the recognition of asymmetric graphs. Over 70% of the analyzed graphs contain symmetries (i.e., graph automorphisms), independent of size and modularity. Therefore, we conclude that real-world graphs are likely to contain symmetries. This contribution is the first larger-scale study of symmetry in graphs and it shows the necessity of handling symmetry in data analysis: The existence of symmetries in graphs is the cause of two problems in graph clustering we are aware of, namely, the existence of multiple equivalent solutions with the same value of the clustering criterion and, secondly, the inability of all standard partition-comparison measures of cluster analysis to identify automorphic partitions as equivalent. © 2018 by the authors.",Graph automorphism groups; Graph symmetry; Real-world networks; Symmetry analysis,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus

One reason for this is that our increasingly digitalized society generates more and more data in all areas of our lives and science and we are desperately seeking for solutions to deal with this problem. In this paper, we investigate the academic roots of data science. We are using data of scientists and their citations from Google Scholar, who have an interest in data science, to perform a quantitative analysis of the data science community. Furthermore, for decomposing the data science community into its major defining factors corresponding to the most important research fields, we introduce a statistical regression model that is fully automatic and robust with respect to a subsampling of the data. This statistical model allows us to define the ‘importance’ of a field as its predictive abilities.

The dataset is noisy, irregular, and lean; however, it is large scale (over a billion events), cheap to collect, and arguably unbiased. We employ the state-of-the-art Big Data techniques to turn this structurally thin dataset into semantically rich insights on commuting, overworking, recreational traveling, shopping, and fast food consumption of the Greater LA population. For example, we reveal that Greater LA residents commute substantially longer than what is reported in the US census data. Also, we show that younger individuals dine at McDonald's significantly more than the older population does.

It evolved over time. Culture is about human intellectual achievements in social context. It is about how humans work together, perform particular task and overall lifestyle and dealing with other groups of civilization. Thus, it is concerned with establishing ideas. Does culture play key role in success? Does it impact on how two individuals can work together in achieving certain goals? Are some key questions. In this paper, we establish a means to derive cultural association and map it to culturally mediated success. Human interactions with the environment are typically in the form of expressions. Association between culture and behavior produce similar beliefs which lead to common principles and actions, while cultural similarity as a set of common expressions and responses. To measure cultural association among different candidates, we propose the use of a Graphical Association Method (GAM). The behaviors of candidates are captured through series of expressions and represented in the graphical form. Association among corresponding node and core nodes is used for the same. The proposed approach gives promising and interesting results. © 2019 IEEE.",Computational social sciences; Cultural computing; Data sciences; Human computer interaction; Machine learning; Natural language processing,Association methods; Core nodes; Graphical forms; Human civilization; Human interactions; On-machines; Social context; Team formation; Machine learning,English,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus

In this setting, the real-time measurement of the density of attendees stationing in - or moving through - the event terrain is central to applications, such as crowd management, emergency support, and quality of service evaluation. Sensing or communication infrastructures (e.g., sensor networks and mobile phones) can be deployed to estimate the number of attendees currently occupying an area. However, the adoption of these technologies is hindered by their cost or sensing resolution. There is evidence that social media data can provide a real-time and semantically rich insight into attendees' behavior during city-scale events. Their suitability as a data source for attendees density estimation is yet to be investigated. With this paper, we aim at filling this knowledge gap by studying how micro-posts harvested from social media can be used during city-scale events to estimate the density of attendees in a given terrain. To cope with issues of temporal and spatial resolution, we propose three classes of density estimation strategies (i.e. geo-based, speed-based, and flow-based) inspired by elements of pedestrian traffic flow theory that were successfully assessed during city-scale events. We study the performance of these strategies in the context of SAIL Amsterdam 2015 (Sail) and Kingsday Amsterdam 2016 (Kingsday), two city-scale events that attracted 2 and 1.5 million of attendees in the span of five days and one day, respectively. We defined four experimental terrains for the Sail event and one for the Kingsday event, and compare density estimates from social media data with measures obtained from counting systems and Wi-Fi sensors. Results show the potential of solutions embedding elements from pedestrian traffic flow theory, which yielded estimates with strong temporal correlations with the sensor observation, and limited mean errors. © 2018 IEEE.",computational social science; Data science; density estimation; social sensing; traffic flow state; urban analytics,Computation theory; Quality of service; Sensor networks; Social networking (online); Urban planning; Computational social science; Data Science; Density estimation; Social sensing; Traffic flow; Urban Analytics; Street traffic control,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus

Since these big social networks have been growing, there are real-life situations in which an individual user wants to find those frequently followed groups of social entities so that he can follow the same groups. Discovery of these frequently followed groups can be challenging because the social networks are usually big with lots of social entities.

The author sets out a social scientific approach to the Fragile Families Challenge. Key insights included new variables constructed according to theory (e.g., a measure of shame relating to hardship), lagged values of the target variables, using predicted values of certain outcomes to inform others, and validated scales rather than individual variables. The models were competitive: a four-variable logistic regression model was placed second for predicting layoffs, narrowly beaten by a model using all the available variables (>10,000) and an ensemble of algorithms. Similarly, a relatively small random forest model (25 variables) was ranked seventh in predicting material hardship. However, a similar approach overfitted the prediction of grit. Machine learning approaches proved superior to linear regression for modeling the continuous outcomes. Overall, social scientists can contribute to predictive performance while benefiting from learning more about data science methods. © SAGE Publications Inc..

ODIN enables us to collect and analyze rich, contextual continuous-time data on both personal change and interpersonal interaction. It achieves this by supporting dynamic delivery of questions based on the currently sensed context of each participant. The ODIN system extends beyond static (or even stepwise dynamic) graph-theoretic renderings of social life and individual behavior by considering 'social relationship' to be measured in terms of high-dimensional continuous-time trajectories. The system is designed to be extensible, allowing seamless incorporation of new sensors, and correspondingly sophisticated compound rules by which contexts of interest may be specified. As such, ODIN opens the door for a 'smarter' social science based on continuous contextual data, and a 'smarter' data science that is reflective and sociologically informed. © 2019 IEEE.",Adaptive survey; Dynamic networks; Ecological momentary assessment; Longitudinal networks; Social network analysis; Temporal networks contextual survey,Behavioral research; Graph theory; Smart city; Trusted computing; Ubiquitous computing; Continuous-time; Dynamic interaction; Graph-theoretic; Health science; High-dimensional; Individual behavior; Social relationships; Software platforms; Continuous time systems,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus

Yet, it has proven difficult to bring these important insights into the practice of data science itself. We suggest that part of this problem has to do with under-examined or unacknowledged assumptions about the relationship between the two fields—ideas about how data science and its critics can and should relate. Inspired by recent work in Science and Technology Studies on interventions, we attempted to stage an encounter in which practicing data scientists were asked to analyze a corpus of critical social science literature about their work, using tools of textual analysis such as co-word and topic modelling. The idea was to provoke discussion both about the content of these texts and the possible limits of such analyses. In this commentary, we reflect on the planning stages of the experiment and how responses to the exercise, from both data scientists and qualitative social scientists, revealed some of the tensions and interactions between the normative positions of the different fields. We argue for further studies which can help us understand what these interdisciplinary tensions turn on—which do not paper over them but also do not take them as given. © The Author(s) 2019.",Algorithms; data science; interdisciplinarity; intervention; reflexivity; Science and Technology Studies,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus

At the growing intersections of these fields, there will be many opportunities and not a few thorny difficulties for STS scholars. First, I discuss how both fields frame the rollout of data science as a simultaneously social and technical endeavor, even if in distinct ways and for diverging purposes. Second, I discuss the logic of domains in contemporary computer, information, and data science circles. While STS is often agnostic about the borders between the sciences or with industry and state—occasionally taking those boundaries as an object of study—data science takes those boundaries as its target to overcome. These two elective affinities present analytic and practical challenges for STS but also opportunities for engagement. Overall, in addition to these typifications, I urge STS scholars to strategically position themselves to investigate and contribute to the breadth of transformations that seek to touch virtually every science and newly bind spheres of academy, industry, and state. © The Author(s) 2018.",cyberinfrastructure; data science; domain; social science; STS; universal science,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus

The sample was made up of 72 students from the National Preparatory School No. 7 ""Ezequiel A. Chávez"" who took the ""Introduction to the Study of Social and Economic Sciences"" course during the 2019-2020 school year. The quantitative approach analyzed the impact on the use of the collaborative wall and mobile devices using the Rapidminer tool (machine learning and data science). The qualitative approach analyzed the students' perceptions about the use of technology. The results of machine learning indicate that the use of the collaborative wall and mobile devices (tablets) as media positively influenced the motivation and interest of the students during the learning process on migration.

In this article, we harness the power of network and data sciences to model the interplay between user demographics and social behavior and further study to what extent users' demographic profiles can be inferred from their mobile communication patterns. By modeling over 7 million users and 1 billion mobile communication records, we find that during the active dating period (i.e., 18-35 years old), users are active in broadening social connections with males and females alike, while after reaching 35 years of age people tend to keep small, closed, and same-gender social circles. Further, we formalize the demographic prediction problem of inferring users' gender and age simultaneously. We propose a factor graph-based WhoAmI method to address the problem by leveraging not only the correlations between network features and users' gender/age, but also the interrelations between gender and age. In addition, we identify a new problem-coupled network demographic prediction across multiple mobile operators- and present a coupled variant of the WhoAmI method to address its unique challenges. Our extensive experiments demonstrate the effectiveness, scalability, and applicability of the WhoAmI methods. Finally, our study finds a greater than 80% potential predictability for inferring users' gender from phone call behavior and 73% for users' age from text messaging interactions. © 2017 ACM.",Computational social science; Demographic prediction; Ego networks; Gender and age; Mobile communication; Mobile phone data; Node attributes; Social tie and triad,Forecasting; Message passing; Population statistics; Social networking (online); Social sciences; Telephone sets; Text messaging; Computational social science; Demographic predictions; Ego networks; Gender and age; Mobile communications; Mobile phone datum; Node attribute; Social ties; Mobile telecommunication systems,English,Article,Final,,Scopus

Banking transactions, education, trade marketing, social networking, etc. are all examples of those daily and important operations that rely on such technologies, which have generated a large amount of data transiting with high velocity in the last decade. This was accompanied by an extraordinary growth in number and sophistication of cyber threats, going from opportunistic and unstructured to targeted and highly structured. Thus, detecting intrusions in such circumstances requires high levels of accuracy and efficiency, so that heavy losses are prevented. Many intrusion detection models in the literature do not propose real-Time solutions to deal with the aforementioned obstacles. This motivates us to propose a lightweight intrusion detection system, for probe and DoS attacks detection. We select the most important set of features using Information Gam (IG). and Correlation- based Feature (CFS) selection filters, applied on a resampled version of KDD'99. Furthermore, we employ four machine learning methods, namely C'4.5, Naive Bayes (NB), Random Forest (RF) and REPTree. as wrappers. Results show good detection and false positive rates, of around 99.6%, and 0.3% for DoS attacks, and 99.8% and 2.7% for Probe attacks. Processmg tune is also optimized when evaluated using the best selected feature subset. © 2018 The Authors.

This article chronicles the collaboration between a team of anthropologists and sociologists, who worked together for one week in an experimental attempt to combine ‘big’ transactional and ‘small’ ethnographic data formats. Our collaboration is part of a larger cross-disciplinary project carried out at the Danish Technical University (DTU), where high-resolution transactional data from smartphones allows for recordings of social networks amongst a freshman class (N = 800). With a parallel deployment of ethnographic fieldwork among the DTU students, this research set-up raises a number of questions concerning how to assemble disparate ‘data-worlds’ and to what epistemological and political effects? To address these questions, a specific social event – a lively student party – was singled out from the broader DTU dataset. Our experimental collaboration used recordings of Bluetooth signals between students’ phones to visualize the ebb and flow of social intensities at the DTU party, juxtaposing these with ethnographic field-notes on shifting party atmospheres. Tracing and reflecting on the process of combining heterogeneous data, the article offers a concrete case of how a ‘stitching together’ of digital and ethnographic data-worlds might take place. © The Author(s) 2017.",Big social data; complementarity; data-worlds; ethnography; experiment; party sociality,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus

These potential usages of view-types trigger a challenging problem, that is to automatically distinguish them into wide or narrow. In this paper, we present a computational model to classify them inspired by the human visual system. We found two cues that can represent the visual attention, i.e., focus cue and scale cue. The focus cue is modeled in the frequency domain using the non-sampled contourlet transform (NSCT) and speeded up robust features (SURF). The scale cue is modeled by defining the spatial size and conceptual sizes of an object in the image, whereby AdobeBING and convolutional neural network are used for the respective measurements. By integrating these focus and scale models, a robust scheme is hence proposed for this non-trivial task. The experiments on a newly established dataset, which has 5050 natural images, show better performance by our proposal when compared to the state-of-the-arts. © 2013 IEEE.",scale size model; scene focus model; View-type classification; visual attention,Frequency domain analysis; Neural networks; Computational model; Contourlet transform; Convolutional neural network; Human Visual System; Scale sizes; Speeded up robust features; Type classifications; Visual Attention; Behavioral research,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus

With the advent of Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning technologies to the majority of the scientific fields, we have begun to analyze the textual content of social media, and more specifically online social networks, to extract insights about the noise attitude of the population that uses this channel to express their opinion in this matter. Some of the state-of-the-art algorithms, such as deep neural networks, are supervised machine learning algorithms. This means that researchers have to provide a set of labelled training data to build new models. The annotation process is known as one of the most time-costly tasks in a data science pipeline, since researchers among other thigs have to test the agreement between annotators and to measure the quality of the categories they had previously defined. For that reason in this paper, we introduce Noytext which is a customizable web tool to annotate texts from your database, that can be deployed in your own webserver and you can use to request help from colleagues and collaborators in the annotation process in a friendly way. © INTER-NOISE 2019 MADRID - 48th International Congress and Exhibition on Noise Control Engineering.

This is a scientifically challenging proposition, as it requires new methods to fuse objective (heterogeneous) data (e.g. people location trails and sensors data) with subjective (perceptual) data (e.g. the citizens' quality of experience collected through feedback forms). When it comes to vast urban areas, collecting statistically significant data is a daunting task; thus new data-collection methods are required too. In this work, we turn to artificial intelligence (AI) to address these challenges, introducing a method whereby the objective, sensor data is analyzed in real-time to scope down the test matrix of the subjective questionnaires. In turn, subjective responses are parsed through AI models to extract further objective information. The outcome is an interactive data analysis framework for urban environments, which we put to test in the context of a citizens' well-being project. In our pilot study, each new entry (objective or subjective) is parsed through the AI engine to determine which action maximizes the information gain. This translates into a particular question being fired at a specific moment and place, to a specific person. With our AI data collection method, we can reach statistical significance much faster, achieving (in our city-wide pilot study) a 41% acceleration factor and a 75% reduction in intrusiveness. Our study opens new avenues in urban science, with potential applications in urban planning, citizen's well-being projects, and sociology, to mention but a few cases. © 2013 IEEE.",artificial intelligence; crowd sensing; data analysis; Data science; smart city; social science; urban analytics,Artificial intelligence; Data handling; Data reduction; Data Science; Information analysis; Quality of service; Smart city; Social sciences; Sociology; Surveys; Urban planning; Acceleration factors; crowd sensing; Data collection method; Interactive data analysis; Objective information; Quality of experience (QoE); Statistical significance; urban analytics; Data acquisition,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus

Unlike other introductory data science courses, such as Berkeley’s Data 8, our course retains the broad array of concepts necessary not only to introduce programming principles related to data science, but also to prepare students for the second course in our standard introductory computer science sequence. In particular, the course includes coverage of recursion (numeric and structural), unit testing, linked data structures, and other concepts we rely upon in subsequent courses in computer science. At the same time, we introduce students to a wide variety of techniques and approaches that support them in their subsequent work in data science, including techniques for wrangling, cleaning, and visualizing data. We achieve this combination of breadth and depth through two core approaches: We focus on a spiral “use then implement” approach and we focus on a functional model of programming using Scheme/Racket. While Python and R are the most commonly used languages for data science, we find that Scheme works particularly well to introduce students to concepts both complex, like map-reduce, and simple, like list filtering. In this paper, we report on the design of the curriculum, particularly the capstone project and the ways in which we incorporate the burgeoning subfield of data science for social good. © 2018 Association for Computing Machinery.",Cross-disciplinary courses; CS1; Data science; Functional programming; Map-reduce; Racket; Scheme,Curricula; Functional programming; Students; Cross-disciplinary; Data science; Map-reduce; Racket; Scheme; Education computing,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus

We can make a glimpse to what social matters shape the Turkish political climate with the lenses of statistical models. We show in which political issues Turkish people agree on the most and in which political issues they are segregated the most.

We report here our findings on a pilot study aimed at better understanding how citizens interact with urban green areas, identify relevant features, spot interaction patterns and, ultimately, recommend interventions to increase well-being. Our study was carried out in Sheffield (UK), where we tracked 1,870 subjects for two different periods (7 and 30 days), covering 760 digitally geo-fenced green areas. Through a smartphone App, we collected both subjective data (personal feelings, type of social interactions, type of activity, and perception of space) and objective data (sensor data, location, time, and photos). We employed data science methods to filter, correlate, cluster, and visualize the data, doing text analysis to extract semantic information from the subjects' responses. Looking at the intensity of interaction between citizens and green spaces, we found a stronger correlation with the quality of the green areas (diversity of natural features, trees, and birds), rather than their size (half of the top visited areas included small squares and gardens). Looking at the type of social interaction taking place within the green areas (lone visits or with friends and family), we found that different social interaction patterns correlate to different types of green area. Interestingly, most of the interactions correlate strongly to the proximity to the city centre, the presence of facilities (sport, parking), and architectural features (listed building, artistic/monumental icons), which indicate that targeted small-scale intervention into central built areas may have more immediate impact towards the citizen's well-being than the more peripheral parks. © 2018 IEEE.",data-Analysis; data-science; smart-cities; social-science; urban-Analytics; urban-planning,Behavioral research; Data reduction; Semantics; Smart city; Social sciences; Urban planning; Architectural features; data-science; Interaction pattern; Large-scale studies; Relevant features; Semantic information; Social interactions; urban-Analytics; Big data,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus

New forms of inquiry into culture have arisen, reshaping quantitative methodologies, the ties between theory and empirical work. The starting point for this article is two influential approaches which have gained a strong following, using computational engineering for the study of cultural phenomena on a large scale: 'distant reading' and 'cultural analytics'. The aim is to show the possibilities and limitations of these approaches in the pursuit of scientific knowledge. The article also focuses on statistics of culture, where integration of big data is challenging procedures. The article concludes that analyses of extensive corpora based on computing may offer significant clues and reveal trends in research on culture. It argues that the human and social sciences, in joining up with computational engineering, need to continue to exercise their ability to perceive societal issues, contextualize objects of study, and discuss the symbolic meanings of extensive worlds of artefacts and discourses. In this way, they may help to overcome the perceived restrictions of large-scale analysis such as the limited attention given to individual actors and the meanings of their actions. © 2018 by the authors.",Big data; Cultural analytics; Data science; Distant reading; Human and social sciences; Positivism/interpretivism/interactionism; Statistics of culture,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus

We use examples drawn from our Science and Technology Studies (STS) analyses of -omic biology and high energy physics to demonstrate the utility of three theoretical concepts: (i) primary and secondary inscriptions, (ii) crafted and found data, and (iii) the locus of legitimate interpretation. These help us to show how the histories, organisational forms, and power dynamics of a field lead to different enactments of big data. The paper suggests that these concepts can be used to help us to understand the ways in which Big Data is being enacted in the domain of the social sciences, and to outline in general terms the ways in which this enactment might be different to that which we have observed in the ‘hard’ sciences. We contend that the locus of legitimate interpretation of Big Data biology and physics is tightly delineated, found within the disciplinary institutions and cultures of these disciplines. We suggest that when using Big Data to make knowledge claims about ‘the social’ the locus of legitimate interpretation is more diffuse, with knowledge claims that are treated as being credible made from other disciplines, or even by those outside academia entirely. © The Author(s) 2018.",big data; Bioinformatics; epistemic culture; locus of legitimate interpretation; physics; social science,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus

Data science techniques, most commonly involving regression analysis and related approaches, serve as a viable means to explore this interplay. However, these tend to extract factors with wide-ranging impact, while overlooking variations specific to individual students. Focusing on each student’s peculiarities is generally impossible with thousands or even hundreds of subjects, yet data mining methods might prove effective in devising more targeted approaches. For instance, subjects with shared characteristics can be assigned to clusters, which can then be examined separately with machine learning algorithms, thereby providing a more nuanced view of the factors affecting individuals in a particular group. In this context, we introduce a data science workflow allowing for fine-grained analysis of academic performance correlates that captures the subtle differences in students’ sensitivities to these factors. Leveraging the Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations (LIME) algorithm from the toolbox of Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques, the proposed pipeline yields groups of students having similar academic attainment indicators, rather than similar features (e.g. familial background) as typically practiced in prior studies. As a proof-of-concept case study, a rich longitudinal dataset is selected to evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed approach versus a standard regression model. © 2020, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Academic performance; Computational social science; Data science; Explainable AI; GPA prediction; LIME; Machine learning,Data mining; Data Science; Lime; Machine learning; Regression analysis; Students; Academic performance; Data mining methods; Fine-grained analysis; Personal characteristics; Proof of concept; Regression model; Learning algorithms,English,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus

Data librarianship has its origins in the social sciences. In particular, the creation of data services and data archives, in the United Kingdom (Data Archives Services) and in the United States and Canada (Data Library Services), is a key factor for the emergence of data librarianship. The focus of data librarianship nowadays is on the creation of new library services. Data librarians are concerned with the proposition of services for data management and curation in academic libraries and other research organizations. The purpose of this paper is to understand how the complexity of the data can serve as the basis for identifying the technical skills required by data librarians. This essay is systematically divided, first introducing the concepts of data and research data in data librarianship, followed by an overview of data science as a theory, method, and technology to assess data. Next, the identification of the competencies and skills required by data scientists and data librarians are discussed. Our final remarks highlight that data librarians should understand that the complexity and novelty associated with data science praxis. Data science provides new methods and practices for data librarianship. A data librarian need not become a programmer, statistician, or database manager, but should be interested in learning about the languages and programming logic of computers, databases, and information retrieval tools. We believe that numerous kinds of scientific data research provide opportunities for a data librarian to engage with data science. © The Author(s) 2017.",Data; data librarian skills; data librarianship; data science; data scientist skills; research data,,English,Review,Final,,Scopus

Vertex coloring of graphs, belonging to the class of combinatorial optimization, represents one such problem. It is well studied for its applications in data sciences, life sciences, social sciences and technology, and hence, motivates alternate, more efficient non-Boolean pathways towards its solution. Here we demonstrate a coupled relaxation oscillator based dynamical system that exploits insulator-metal transition in Vanadium Dioxide (VO2) to efficiently solve vertex coloring of graphs. Pairwise coupled VO2 oscillator circuits have been analyzed before for basic computing operations, but using complex networks of VO2 oscillators, or any other oscillators, for more complex tasks have been challenging in theory as well as in experiments. The proposed VO2 oscillator network harnesses the natural analogue between optimization problems and energy minimization processes in highly parallel, interconnected dynamical systems to approximate optimal coloring of graphs. We further indicate a fundamental connection between spectral properties of linear dynamical systems and spectral algorithms for graph coloring. Our work not only elucidates a physics-based computing approach but also presents tantalizing opportunities for building customized analog co-processors for solving hard problems efficiently. © 2017 The Author(s).",,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus

This shared data generates an increasing availability of unstructured, informal and yet valuable information to data science researchers. Traditional approaches are not the wisest path for collecting and studying consumer behavior because they require a large amount of time and resources and therefore lead to considerable losses for companies. In this paper, we develop a system able to identify and classify sentiment represented in an electronic text from Twitter where users post real-time reactions and opinions called tweets; that are sentences limited to 280 characters about everything to improve the decision-making process for companies. To do so, we used tweepy to access Twitters Streaming API, we combined natural language processing techniques with naive Bayes networks to classify users data, we used GIS (geographical information system) and Matplotlib for data visualization and displaying the results. The purpose of this paper is to propose an efficient approach for predicting accurate sentiment from raw unstructured data in order to extract opinions from the Internet and predict online customers preferences, which could be valuable and crucial for economic and marketing researchers. © 2018 IEEE.",Data science; GIS (geographical information system); NLP (natural language processing); Opinion mining; Sentiment analysis; Social science; Text mining,Bayesian networks; Classification (of information); Commerce; Consumer behavior; Data Science; Data visualization; Decision making; Geographic information systems; Information systems; Information use; Intelligent systems; Sentiment analysis; Social networking (online); Social sciences; Decision making process; NAtural language processing; Nlp (natural language processing); Opinion mining; Social media platforms; Text mining; Traditional approaches; Unstructured data; Data mining,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus

In this paper, we investigate a novel way of analyzing data from social sciences studies by employing machine learning and data science techniques. This enables us to maximize the insight gained from this type of studies by fusing both objective (sensor information) and subjective data (direct input from the users). The pilot study is concerned with better understanding the interactions between citizens and urban green spaces. A field experiment was carried out in Sheffield, U.K., involving 1870 participants for two different time periods (7 and 30 days). With the help of a smartphone app, both objective and subjective data were collected. Location tracking was recorded as people entered any of the publicly accessible green spaces. This was complemented by textual and photographic information that users could insert spontaneously or when prompted (when entering a green space). By employing data science and machine learning techniques, we identify the main features observed by the citizens through both text and images. Furthermore, we analyze the time spent by people in parks as well as the top interaction areas. This paper allows us to gain an overview of certain patterns and the behavior of the citizens within their surroundings and it proves the capabilities of integrating technology into large-scale social studies. © 2019 IEEE.",Data analysis; data science; smart cities; social science; urban analytics; urban planning,Behavioral research; Data reduction; Data Science; Machine learning; Social sciences; Urban planning; Digital technologies; Integrating technology; Interaction area; Machine learning techniques; Publicly accessible; Sensor informations; urban analytics; Urban green spaces; Smart city,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus

In these fields, the research has been focused on analyzing the fairness, accountability and transparency (FAT) properties of specific algorithms and their outputs. Although these issues are most apparent in the social sciences where fairness is interpreted in terms of the distribution of resources across protected groups, management of bias in source data affects a variety of fields. Consider climate change studies that require representative data from geographically diverse regions, or supply chain analyses that require data that represents the diversity of products and customers. Any domain that involves sparse or sampled data has exposure to potential bias. In this vision paper, we argue that FAT properties must be considered as database system issues, further upstream in the data science lifecycle: bias in source data goes unnoticed, and bias may be introduced during pre-processing (fairness), spurious correlations lead to reproducibility problems (accountability), and assumptions made during pre-processing have invisible but significant effects on decisions (transparency). As machine learning methods continue to be applied broadly by non-experts, the potential for misuse increases. We see a need for a data sharing and collaborative analytics platform with features to encourage (and in some cases, enforce) best practices at all stages of the data science lifecycle. We describe features of such a platform, which we term Fides, in the context of urban analytics, outlining a systems research agenda in responsible data science. © 2017 Association for Computing Machinery.",Accountability; Data; Data ethics; Data science for social good; Fairness; Responsibly; Transparency,Artificial intelligence; Climate change; Database systems; Distributed computer systems; Education; Learning systems; Life cycle; Management information systems; Supply chains; Transparency; Accountability; Data; Data ethics; Data science for social good; Fairness; Responsibly; Information management,English,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus

The latest developments in the area of contagion processes modeling are discussed, and readers are exposed to real world examples of data-model integration impacting the decision-making process. Recent advances in computational science and the increasing availability of real-world data are making it possible to develop realistic scenarios and real-time forecasts of the global spreading of emerging health threats. The first part of the book guides the reader through sophisticated complex systems modeling techniques with a non-technical and visual approach, explaining and illustrating the construction of the modern framework used to project the spread of pandemics and epidemics. Models can be used to transform data to knowledge that is intuitively communicated by powerful infographics and for this reason, the second part of the book focuses on a set of charts that illustrate possible scenarios of future pandemics. The visual atlas contained allows the reader to identify commonalities and patterns in emerging health threats, as well as explore the wide range of models and data that can be used by policy makers to anticipate trends, evaluate risks and eventually manage future events. Charting the Next Pandemic puts the reader in the position to explore different pandemic scenarios and to understand the potential impact of available containment and prevention strategies. This book emphasizes the importance of a global perspective in the assessment of emerging health threats and captures the possible evolution of the next pandemic, while at the same time providing the intelligence needed to fight it. The text will appeal to a wide range of audiences with diverse technical backgrounds. © Springer International Publishing AG, part of Springer Nature 2019.","complex systems; computational epidemiology; computational social sciences; containment and mitigation scenarios; data driven modeling; data science; data-driven science, Modeling and theory building; epidemic data modeling; epidemic spreading; infectious diseases; modeling disease transmission",,English,Book,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus

Despite the broad and increasing social effects of these events, the empirical basis of disaster research is often weak, partially due to the natural paucity of observed data. At the same time, some of the early research regarding social responses to disasters have become outdated as social, cultural, and political norms have changed. The digital revolution, the open data trend, and the advancements in data science provide new opportunities for social science disaster research. We introduce the term computational social science of disasters (CSSD), which can be formally defined as the systematic study of the social behavioral dynamics of disasters utilizing computational methods. In this paper, we discuss and showcase the opportunities and the challenges in this new approach to disaster research. Following a brief review of the fields that relate to CSSD, namely traditional social sciences of disasters, computational social science, and crisis informatics, we examine how advances in Internet technologies offer a new lens through which to study disasters. By identifying gaps in the literature, we show how this new field could address ways to advance our understanding of the social and behavioral aspects of disasters in a digitally connected world. In doing so, our goal is to bridge the gap between data science and the social sciences of disasters in rapidly changing environments. © 2019 by the authors.",Big data; Computational social science; Crisis informatics; Crowdsourcing; Disaster modeling; Disasters; Social media; Volunteered geographical information; Web 2.0,Behavioral research; Big data; Crowdsourcing; Data Science; Disasters; Open Data; Social sciences computing; Computational social science; Crisis informatics; Geographical information; Social media; Web 2.0; Economic and social effects,English,Review,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus

Learning health systems require not only data, but feedback loops of knowledge into changed practice. This depends on knowledge management and application, which in turn depends upon effective system design and implementation. Biomedical informatics is the interdisciplinary field at the intersection of health science, social science and information science and technology that spans this entire scope. Issues In the UK, the separate worlds of health data science (bioinformatics, 'Big Data') and effective healthcare system design and implementation (clinical informatics, 'Digital Health') have operated as 'two cultures'. Much National Health Service and social care data is of very poor quality. Substantial research funding is wasted on 'data cleansing' or by producing very weak evidence. There is not yet a sufficiently powerful professional community or evidence base of best practice to influence the practitioner community or the digital health industry. Recommendation The UK needs increased clinical informatics research and education capacity and capability at much greater scale and ambition to be able to meet policy expectations, address the fundamental gaps in the discipline's evidence base and mitigate the absence of regulation. Independent evaluation of digital health interventions should be the norm, not the exception. Conclusions Policy makers and research funders need to acknowledge the existing gap between the 'two cultures' and recognise that the full social and economic benefits of digital health and data science can only be realised by accepting the interdisciplinary nature of biomedical informatics and supporting a significant expansion of clinical informatics capacity and capability.

Any data interpretation depends critically on understanding of the scope and limitations in data collection, as well as on reliable downstream analysis. Quantitative analysis can complement qualitative research by providing access to overlooked information that is accessible only through systematic discovery and analysis of latent patterns underlying the available data collections. Probabilistic programming is an expanding paradigm in machine learning that provides new statistical tools for intuitive interpretation of complex data sets. This new paradigm stems from Bayesian analysis and emphasizes explicit modeling of the data generating processes and associated uncertainties. Despite its remarkable application potential, probabilistic programming has so far received little attention in computational humanities. We use a brief case study in computational history to demonstrate how probabilistic programming can be incorporated in reproducible data science workflows in order to detect and quantify bias in a widely studied historical text collection, the Eighteenth Century Collections Online.  © 2020 Copyright for this paper by its authors.",Bias; Bibliographic data science; Computational history; Probabilistic programming; Uncertainty,Data Science; Humanities computing; Statistical mechanics; Uncertainty analysis; Bayesian Analysis; Complex datasets; Data interpretation; Explicit modeling; Humanities and social science; Probabilistic programming; Qualitative research; Statistical tools; Data acquisition,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus

In the UK, capturing detailed data about students has become a government priority, with an emphasis on using student data to measure, compare and assess university performance. The purpose of this paper is to examine the governmental and commercial drivers of current large-scale technological efforts to collect and analyse student data in UK HE. The result is an expanding data infrastructure which includes large-scale and longitudinal datasets, learning analytics services, student apps, data dashboards and digital learning platforms powered by artificial intelligence (AI). Education data scientists have built positive pedagogic cases for student data analysis, learning analytics and AI. The politicization and commercialization of the wider HE data infrastructure is translating them into performance metrics in an increasingly market-driven sector, raising the need for policy frameworks for ethical, pedagogically valuable uses of student data in HE. Practitioner Notes What is already known about this topic Learning analytics, education data science and artificial intelligence are opening up new ways of collecting and analysing student data in higher education. UK government policies emphasize the use of student data for improvements to teaching and learning. What this paper adds A conceptual framework from “infrastructure studies” demonstrates how political objectives and commercial aims are fused to HE data systems, with data infrastructure becoming a key tool of government reform. A critical infrastructure analysis shows that student data processing technologies are being developed and deployed to measure university performance through student data. Implications for practice and/or policy Educators and managers in universities need to prepare robust institutional frameworks to govern their use of student data. Learning analytics practitioners, data scientists, learning scientists and social science researchers need to collaborate with the policy community and education technology developers on new policy frameworks to challenge narrow uses of student data as performance metrics. © 2019 British Educational Research Association",,Artificial intelligence; Binary alloys; Commerce; Data handling; E-learning; Large dataset; Metadata; Public policy; Social sciences computing; Conceptual frameworks; Data infrastructure; Data processing technologies; Education technology; Institutional framework; Performance metrics; Teaching and learning; Technological effort; Students,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus

This new data availability creates an opportunity, especially in geospatial data science where this new, dynamic, data allows novel insight into phenomena ranging from environmental to social sciences. Much work has focused on creating venues or portals for publishing and accessing such dynamic datasets. However access to data in itself is not sufficient—to turn data into information the data needs to be filtered, correlated, and otherwise analyzed using methods that are dynamically developed and constantly improved by a distributed community of experts. Further, these methods are increasingly required to deliver results with specific qualities of service, e.g., providing results by a certain deadline or ensuring a certain accuracy of the results. Delivering such qualities of service requires generic but often sophisticated tools managing the execution of operations and ensuring their correctness. This paper presents LambdaLink, an operation management platform for multi-cloud environments, and explains how it supports the structured contribution and repeatable, time-controlled execution of operations. We describe the architecture and implementation of LambdaLink, its approach to appliance management in a multi-cloud context, and compare it with related systems. © 2017 Copyright held by the owner/author(s).",Cloud computing; Lambda; Operation Management Platform; Repeatable Execution,Cloud computing; Information filtering; Data availability; Geo-spatial data; Lambda; Operation management; Related systems; Repeatable Execution; Sensing devices; Time-controlled; Environmental management,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus

This has led to a burgeoning but scattered social science body of literature. There is hence lack of overview of how this field of study is developing, and what are established, emerging, and new themes and topics. This is where this article aims to make a contribution, beyond introducing this special issue which presents seventeen articles dealing with social, economic and institutional dynamics of precision farming, digital agriculture, smart farming or agriculture 4.0. An exploratory literature review shows that five thematic clusters of extant social science literature on digitalization in agriculture can be identified: 1) Adoption, uses and adaptation of digital technologies on farm; 2) Effects of digitalization on farmer identity, farmer skills, and farm work; 3) Power, ownership, privacy and ethics in digitalizing agricultural production systems and value chains; 4) Digitalization and agricultural knowledge and innovation systems (AKIS); and 5) Economics and management of digitalized agricultural production systems and value chains. The main contributions of the special issue articles are mapped against these thematic clusters, revealing new insights on the link between digital agriculture and farm diversity, new economic, business and institutional arrangements both on-farm, in the value chain and food system, and in the innovation system, and emerging ways to ethically govern digital agriculture. Emerging lines of social science enquiry within these thematic clusters are identified and new lines are suggested to create a future research agenda on digital agriculture, smart farming and agriculture 4.0. Also, four potential new thematic social science clusters are also identified, which so far seem weakly developed: 1) Digital agriculture socio-cyber-physical-ecological systems conceptualizations; 2) Digital agriculture policy processes; 3) Digitally enabled agricultural transition pathways; and 4) Global geography of digital agriculture development. This future research agenda provides ample scope for future interdisciplinary and transdisciplinary science on precision farming, digital agriculture, smart farming and agriculture 4.0. © 2019 The Authors",Agricultural knowledge and innovation systems; Data science; Digital social science; Digitalization; Precision agriculture; Responsible research and innovation; Robotic farming,agricultural production; ethics; innovation; literature review; ownership; precision; research method; robotics,English,Review,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus

Once maligned, on the one hand by those who philosophically hated the very idea of subjective probability used in prior specification, and on the other hand because of the intractability of the computations needed for Bayesian estimation and inference, the Bayesian school of thought now permeates and pervades virtually all areas of science, applied science, engineering, social science and even liberal arts, often in unsuspected ways. Thanks in part to the availability of powerful computing resources, but also to the literally unavoidable inherent presence of the quintessential building blocks of the Bayesian paradigm in all walks of life, the Bayesian way of handling statistical learning, estimation and inference is not only mainstream but also becoming the most central approach to learning from the data. This paper explores some of the most relevant elements to help to the reader appreciate the pervading power and presence of the Bayesian paradigm in statistics, artificial intelligence and data science, with an emphasis on how the Gospel according to Reverend Thomas Bayes has turned out to be the truly good news, and in some cases the amazing saving grace, for all who seek to learn statistically from the data © 2019, Mathematics for Applications.All Rights Reserved.",Bayes learner; Bayes' theorem; bayesian learning; data science; learning machine; posterior distribution; prior specification; regularization; statistical learning theory,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus

However, the field is crowded with terminology that makes it difficult to establish reasonable project scopes and to staff and manage projects. This study clarifies the terminology around data science, computational social science, big data, business intelligence, and analytics, and defines decision support projects. The study uses quantitative methods to empirically classify the project scopes, investigate the similarities and differences between the project types, and identify the critical success factors. The results suggest BI and big data analytics projects are differentiated based on analytics competence, proprietary algorithms, and distinctive business processes. They are significantly different for 19 of the 52 items evaluated. For big data analytics projects, many of the items are correlated with strategic benefits, while for BI projects they are associated with the operational benefits of cost and revenue performance. Project complexity is driven by the project characteristics for BI projects, while the external market drives the complexity of big data analytics projects.

Our research focuses on the question, 'How are data analytics involved in policy analysis to create complementary values?' We address this from the perspective of bibliometrics. We initially investigate a set of articles published in Nature and Science, seeking cutting-edge knowledge to sharpen research hypotheses on what data science offers policy analysis. Based on a set of bibliometric models (e.g., topic analysis, scientific evolutionary pathways, and social network analysis), we follow up with studies addressing two aspects: (1) we examine the engagement of data science (including statistical, econometric, and computing approaches) in current policy analyses by analyzing articles published in top-level journals in the areas of political science and public administration; and (2) we examine the development of policy analysis-oriented data analytic models in top-level journals associated with computer science (including both artificial intelligence and information systems). Observations indicate that data science contribution to policy analysis is still an emerging area. Data scientists are moving further than policy analysts, due to technical difficulties in exploiting data analytic models.

These are users that are over-proportionally active in relation to the mean. By applying a geometric topic modeling algorithm (GTM) on German users’ political comments and parties’ posts and by analyzing commenting and liking activities, we quantitatively demonstrate that hyperactive users have a significant role in the political discourse: They become opinion leaders, as well as having an agenda-setting effect, thus creating an alternate picture of public opinion. We also show that hyperactive users strongly influence specific types of recommender systems. By training collaborative filtering and deep learning recommendation algorithms on simulated political networks, we illustrate that models provide different suggestions to users, when accounting for or ignoring hyperactive behavior both in the input dataset and in the methodology applied. We attack the trained models with adversarial examples by strategically placing hyperactive users in the network and manipulating the recommender systems’ results. Given that recommender systems are used by all major social networks, that they come with a social influence bias, and given that OSNs are not per se designed to foster political discussions, we discuss the implications for the political discourse and the danger of algorithmic manipulation of political communication. © 2019 The Author(s)",Agenda setting; Algorithmic bias; Computational social science; Hyperactive users; Political communication; Political data science; Recommendation systems; Recommender systems; Social media; Topic modeling,Collaborative filtering; Deep learning; Learning algorithms; Recommender systems; Social aspects; Agenda settings; Algorithmic bias; Computational social science; Hyperactive users; Political communication; Social media; Topic Modeling; Social networking (online),English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus

If a VR designer employs any system of attentional cues, they might be interested in measuring the system’s effectiveness. Eye tracking (ET) time series data can be used as a visual attention trail and positional time series data can be used as spatial behavior trails. In this paper we are addressing the issue of measuring inter-subject dependence in visual attention and spatial behavior. We are arguing why recently developed distance correlation coefficient [1, 2] might be both a proper and convenient choice to either measure the inter-subject dependence or test for the inter-subject independence in visual and behavioral data recorded during a VR experience. © 2019, Springer Nature Switzerland AG.",Applied statistics; Attention; Behavior; Data science; Distance correlation; Distance variance; Energy statistics; Eye tracking; Human-Technology Interaction; Narration; Positional tracking; Psychology; Research methodology; Social sciences; User experience; Virtual reality,Eye tracking; Integration; Intelligent systems; Social sciences; Social sciences computing; Time series; Virtual reality; Applied statistics; Attention; Behavior; Data science; Distance variances; Energy statistics; Human-technology interaction; Narration; Psychology; Research methodologies; User experience; Behavioral research,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus

Social network have a largest dataset of people profile, comments and their day to events with photographs. Some people hide the personal data such as age, gender and other demographics. The sentimental analysis is used for the business, political reviews and social opinion about the events. For the sentimental analysis and opinion mining the age and gender are the dominant features. The social nature of the people has been changed as per the age group and gender. This research provides the one of the most relevant parameter of user profile in account creation strategy such as age group. The behavior of the same age group persons are similar and the behavior is homogeneous if discussion of the same topic. The dataset for this experiment has been collected from the Facebook, Twitter. The dataset was 20,000 sample sentences. The experiment was tested over the collected sample sentence dataset. The detail analysis has been done with use of punctuation, number of character, topic used in the sentence. The above characteristics are used for the age group classification. This dataset has been tested deep convolution neural network algorithm for classification of age group as a two class such as teenager and adult age group. Deep Convolution Neural Network (DCNN) had the best performance, reaching a precision of 0.89 in the validation tests.

This study aims to investigate the interaction of citizens with the urban green areas, with a view to improve wellbeing through targeted, financial-efficient interventions. A field experiment has been carried out in Sheffield, UK involving 1,870 participants. We collected both objective and subjective data, using a tailor-made smartphone app. Location tracking was activated as soon as people entered any of the publicly accessible green areas, to automatically determine type of activity and interaction. This was complemented by textual and photographic information that users could insert spontaneously or when prompted. We could thus establish interaction patterns and map these to demographics, using data science methods to find out the particular features that affected wellbeing, for different categories. Using text and image analysis, we found a distinctive clustering around age and gender, showing that different categories are interested in specific features. The younger age group (18-35 years) prioritized the presence of urban features in parks, whereas the older group (54-72 years) paid more attention to nature. Pinpointing the particular elements that improve human interaction with the urban green spaces, is the starting point for improving city management and planning using technology and science. © 2018 IEEE.",data analysis; data science; smart cities; social science; urban analytics; urban planning,Data reduction; Data Science; Smart city; Social sciences; Urban planning; Digital technologies; Field experiment; Human interactions; Interaction pattern; Publicly accessible; urban analytics; Urban green area; Urban green spaces; Population statistics,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus

Here I make a simple point-evaluating the appropriateness of an algorithm requires understanding the domain space in which it will operate. While data science enables one to transcend expertise in a particular domain, it nevertheless requires a deep familiarity with the question it is required to answer. Focusing on the answer rather than the question presents significant dangers. These are not necessarily physical hazards, but rather dangers to things like social norms, rule of law values, and the experience of equality. Deploying algorithms that do not avoid these dangers risks injustice in individual cases as well as generating longer term threats to fundamental social and democratic values. Consider the context of criminal justice. Risk assessment tools are increasingly used, particularly in the United States, to make decisions about bail, parole, and sentencing. © 2018 IEEE.",,Engineering; Social sciences; Criminal justice; Risk assessment tool; Social norm; Risk assessment,English,Review,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus

An effective direction for interdisciplinary extension of LIS needs to be explored. By using logic analysis the authors found that data intelligence and knowledge discovery possess rationality as an effective direction based on data-information-knowledge-wisdom DIKW chain. This way follows the core clues of Resource Book -Man User -Service Use from library science and Data- Information- Knowledge from information science. The concept chain also takes the basic model of information science as basis integrates the basic principles of data science and finally realizes the connection of “data-knowledge-intelligence”.The authors proposed that there are three keys for the interdisciplinary extension of LIS by interactions of data intelligence and knowledge discovery including 1 data intelligence facing knowledge discovery 2 knowledge discovery penetrating data intelligence and 3 synthetic applications in academic assessment. Two typical projects “Engineering science and technology oriented multi-source data mining of social demands in Shanghai” and “Frontiers of Internationalization of Chinese Philosophy and Social Sciences” are applied for identifying theoretical effectiveness. In view of the division of “soft science hard technology” the authors suggested that LIS exert the comparative advantages and take data intelligence and knowledge discovery as the special direction to make an integration of data-academy-creativity or digital academic culture DAC. LIS might take the development strategy through the “hard expansion” of information technology and the “soft expansion” of management and economics for promoting the interdisciplinary extension. 4 figs. 1 tab. 18 refs. © 2020, Editorial Office of Journal of Library Science in China.

In contrast to previous studies that were mainly based on questionnaire surveys, recent literature suggests that unobtrusive digital data bring us unprecedented opportunities to study students' lifestyles in the campus. In this paper, we collect behavioural records from undergraduate students' (N = 18 960) smart cards and propose two high-level behavioural characters, orderliness and diligence. The former is a novel entropy-based metric that measures the regularity of campus daily life, which is estimated here based on temporal records of taking showers and having meals. Empirical analyses on such large-scale unobtrusive behavioural data demonstrate that academic performance (GPA) is significantly correlated with orderliness. Furthermore, we show that orderliness is an important feature to predict academic performance, which improves the prediction accuracy even in the presence of students' diligence. Based on these analyses, education administrators could quantitatively understand the major factors leading to excellent or poor performance, detect undesirable abnormal behaviours in time and thus implement effective interventions to better guide students' campus lives at an early stage when necessary. © 2018 The Author(s).",academic performance; campus behaviour; computational social science; data science; human behaviour; orderliness,Academic Success; Algorithms; Area Under Curve; Behavior; China; Computer Simulation; Data Science; Educational Status; Entropy; Humans; Life Style; Universities; Behavioral research; Smart cards; Surveys; Academic performance; campus behaviour; Computational social science; data science; Human behaviours; orderliness; abnormal behavior; academic achievement; Article; controlled study; data collection method; education program; entropy; human; lifestyle; prediction; quantitative analysis; questionnaire; student attitude; undergraduate student; university; academic success; algorithm; area under the curve; behavior; China; computer simulation; educational status; Students,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus

We report analyses predicting layoff in the Fragile Families data as part of the Fragile Families Challenge. Our model, grounded in empirical social science research on layoff, did not perform substantially worse than the best-performing model using data science techniques. This result is not fully unforeseen, given that layoff functions as a relatively exogenous shock. Future work using the results of the Challenge should attend to whether small improvements in prediction models, like those we observe across models of layoff, nevertheless significantly increase the validity of subsequent models for causal inference. © SAGE Publications Inc..

Drawing on expertise from a range of disciplines, including psychology, applied statistics, health sciences, neuroscience, communication, computer science, and information technology, we examine the critical processes of contemplative approaches and aim to guide the scientific research of contemplative practices. The book includes pedagogical and experimental aspects of studies such as research design, measurement, program assessment, statistical modeling, data mining, technology integration, and evaluation. It aims to serve as a forum to inspire empirical studies of contemplative practices that address the complexity and variety of such practice in a thoughtful way. It includes compiled interpretation of bodily manifestations of contemplative practices, psychological analysis of contemplative practices, and systematic studies of the effect of contemplative practices through data analysis. Together, the chapters of this book offer first steps along a path to deeper understanding of contemplative practices. Empirical Studies of Contemplative Practices can serve as a reference book to scholars, researchers, and graduate students across fields of natural and social science. Specifically, this book may be of interest in scholarly arenas such as life sciences, psychology, communication, healthcare, education, and data science. We also hope to draw attention from meditation practitioners as well as those who are interested in religious and philosophical studies. We hope that the systematic study of contemplative approaches can make an impact on the larger population in their daily lives. © 2018 by Nova Science Publishers, Inc.

Secure data enclaves provide a solution for managing and analyzing private data. However, they do not readily support discovery science-a form of exploratory or interactive analysis by which researchers execute a range of analyses in an iterative and collaborative manner. The batch computing model offered by many data enclaves is well suited to executing large compute tasks; however it is far from ideal for day-to-day discovery science as the high latencies inherent in queue-based, batch computing systems hinder interactive analysis. In this paper we describe how we have augmented the Cloud Kotta secure data enclave to support collaborative and interactive analysis of sensitive data.

However, these relationships do not necessarily offer an understanding of the processes underlying the data. To address this problem, we have developed a method for fitting nonlinear dynamical systems models to data related to social change. Here, we use this method to investigate how countries become trapped at low levels of socioeconomic development. We identify two types of traps. The first is a democracy trap, where countries with low levels of economic growth and/or citizen education fail to develop democracy. The second trap is in terms of cultural values, where countries with low levels of democracy and/or life expectancy fail to develop emancipative values. We show that many key developing countries, including India and Egypt, lie near the border of these development traps, and we investigate the time taken for these nations to transition toward higher democracy and socioeconomic well-being. © Shyam Ranganathan et al. 2015; Published by Mary Ann Liebert, Inc.",big data analytics; mathematics; predictive analytics,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus

Such uses of the scientific analysis of data and information have enabled hydrocarbons to remain the primary source of energy, worldwide. Data science unlocks patterns typically unseen in typically available information, thus allowing the industry to see hydrocarbons where previously they were not able to confirm their presence. Other industries that specialize in demographic analysis of data, like Google and Yahoo, use data science to see patterns in human interest, which they then make marketable by selling to manufacturers of goods to target increased sales. Baker Hughes has leveraged what it has been doing for years with data science in its Geoscience expertise, to more completely exploit hydrocarbon reserves; to now better exploit previously untapped revelations from safety incident data. Building on the work that Behavioral Science Technology undertook in 2011 with seven global companies (ExxonMobil, Potash Corp, Shell, BHP Billiton, Cargill, Archer Daniel Midland Company, and Maersk), in their publication ""New Findings on Serious Injuries and Fatalities""; and, the further work that ExxonMobil has undertaking with their ""Mining the Diamond"" approach to safety data analysis, as first reported by Neil Duffin, President - ExxonMobil Development Company, at the 2012 Offshore Technology Conference, Baker Hughes has taken this approach farther. The use of data science applied to safety is revealing previously unseen trends in existing safety incident (near miss and where harm was caused) data. We call this application, ""Data Drilling"". The results of Data Drilling are provocative, as they better guide the business to more clearly understand root cause, which precipitates more accurate intervention strategies and effective management of risk (in a high risk industry). Additionally, the products of Data Drilling present a clear and compelling picture of risk management to executives, enabling stronger safety leadership to their organizations. The results of four retrospective studies, of the industry's experience with Dropped Objects, Wellbore Placement During Drilling, Wireline Pressure Control Equipment, and Coil Tubing Operations, are used as examples of how Data Drilling unlocks meaningful root cause that better targets responsible HSE management. In each case, business leadership was presented with a more accurate assessment of risk than traditional oil and gas industry data trending techniques typically reveal. As a result, decisions to support program and process upgrades and capital expenditures for risk mitigating engineering controls are better made.

The analysis is performed by transforming the corpus into a narrative network, whose nodes are actors, whose links are actions, and whose communities represent tightly interacting parts of society. We observe how the relative importance of these communities evolves over time, as well as the centrality of various actors. All this provides an automated way to analyze how different actors and institutions shaped public discourse over a time span of 150 years.

This calls for critical attention to the ‘social life’ of its methods in terms of their historical, technical and methodological provenance; their affordances to generate data for circulation within the institutional circuitry of Pearson and to its wider social networks; their capacity to configure research users’ interpretations; and their generativity to produce the knowledge to influence education policy decisions and pedagogic practices.

Computational social science has three important features. Firstly, it often involves big data; data sets so large that conventional database and analysis techniques cannot handle them with ease. Secondly, dealing with these big data sets has given rise to analysis techniques that are specially developed for big data. Given the size of the data, resampling and cross-validation approaches become feasible that allow both datadriven exploration and checks on overfitting the data. A third important feature is simulation, especially agent-based simulation. Here size also matters. Agent-based simulation is well known in social science, but modern computer equipment and software allows simulations of unprecedented scale. Many of these techniques, especially the resampling and cross-validation approaches, are potentially very useful for social scientists. Given the relatively small size of social science ""big data"" is useful to explore how well these techniques perform with smaller data sets. Social science methodology can contribute to this field by exploring if well-known methodological distinctions between external validity, internal validity, and construct validity can help clear up discussions on data quality (veracity) in computational social science. © 2017 Hogrefe Publishing.",Analytics; Big data; Computational social science; Data science,,English,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Hybrid Gold Open Access,Scopus

While this field is not new - Axelrod's first computational work on the evolution of cooperation goes back to 1981 - CSS has recently resurged under the pressure of quantitative social science and the application of Big Data analytics to social datasets. However, Big Data is no panacea and the data deluge that it provides raises more questions than it answers. The aim of this paper is to present an overview in which CSS will be introduced and the costs of CSS will be balanced against its benefits, in an attempt to propose an integrative view of the new and the old practice of CSS. In particular, two routes to integration will be drawn. First, it will be advocated that social data mining and computational modeling need to be integrated. Second, we will introduce the generative approach, aimed to understand how social phenomena can be generated starting from the micro-components, including psychological mechanisms, and we will discuss the necessity of combining it with the anticipatory, data-driven objective. By these means, Computational Social Science will develop into a more comprehensive field of Computational Social and Behavioral Science in which data science, ICT, as well as the behavioral and social sciences will be fruitfully integrated. © 2016 Hogrefe Publishing.",Agent-based simulation; Big data; Computational social science; Epistemology,,English,Review,Final,,Scopus

Understanding the causes of this gen-der imbalance would inform both policies intended to rec-tify it and employment decisions by departments and indi-viduals. Progress in this direction, however, is complicated by the complexity and decentralized nature of faculty hir-ing and the non-independence of hires. Using comprehen-sive data on both hiring outcomes and scholarly productiv-ity for 2659 tenure-Track faculty across 205 Ph.D.-granting departments in North America, we investigate the multi-dimensional nature of gender inequality in computer science faculty hiring through a network model of the hiring pro-cess. Overall, we find that hiring outcomes are most di-rectly a-ected by (i) the relative prestige between hiring and placing institutions and (ii) the scholarly productivity of the candidates. After including these, and other features, the addition of gender did not significantly reduce modeling error. However, gender differences do exist, e.g., in schol-arly productivity, postdoctoral training rates, and in career movements up the rankings of universities, suggesting that the effects of gender are indirectly incorporated into hiring decisions through gender's covariates. Furthermore, we find evidence that more highly ranked departments recruit fe-male faculty at higher than expected rates, which appears to inhibit similar efforts by lower ranked departments. These findings illustrate the subtle nature of gender inequality in faculty hiring networks and provide new insights to the un-derrepresentation of women in computer science.",Data science; Em-ployment networks; Gender; Modeling; Network analysis; Social dynamics,Electric network analysis; Employment; Models; Productivity; Social sciences; World Wide Web; Covariates; Data science; Gender; Gender differences; Model errors; Multi dimensional; Network modeling; Social dynamics; Computer networks,English,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus

However, traditional systems for measuring the spread of flu infections deliver results with one or two weeks delay. Recent research suggests that data on queries made to the search engine Google can be used to address this problem, providing real-time estimates of levels of influenza-like illness in a population. Others have however argued that equally good estimates of current flu levels can be forecast using historic flu measurements. Here, we build dynamic ‘nowcasting’ models; in other words, forecasting models that estimate current levels of influenza, before the release of official data one week later. We find that when using Google Flu Trends data in combination with historic flu levels, the mean absolute error (MAE) of in-sample ‘nowcasts’ can be significantly reduced by 14.4%, compared with a baseline model that uses historic data on flu levels only. We further demonstrate that the MAE of out-of-sample nowcasts can also be significantly reduced by between 16.0% and 52.7%, depending on the length of the sliding training interval.We conclude that, using adaptive models, Google Flu Trends data can indeed be used to improve real-time influenza monitoring, even when official reports of flu infections are available with only one week’s delay. © 2014 The Authors.",Complex systems; Computational social science; Data science,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus

This is especially true in fields such as medicine and the social sciences, where large amounts of data can be gathered and mined to find insightful relationships among variables. Data in such fields involves humans, however, and thus raises issues of privacy that are not faced by fields such as physics or astronomy. Such privacy issues become more pronounced when researchers try to share their data with others. Data sharing is a core feature of big-data science, allowing others to verify research that has been done and to pursue other lines of inquiry that the original researchers may not have attempted. But sharing data about human subjects triggers a number of regulatory regimes designed to protect the privacy of those subjects. Sharing medical data, for example, requires adherence to HIPAA (Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act); sharing educational data triggers the requirements of FERPA (Family Educational Rights to Privacy Act). These laws require that, to share data generally, the data be de-identified or anonymized (note that, for the purposes of this article, these terms are interchangeable). While FERPA and HIPAA define the notion of de-identification slightly differently, the core idea is that if a data set has certain values removed, the individuals whose data is in the set cannot be identified, and their privacy will be preserved. Previous research has looked at how well these requirements protect the identities of those whose data is in a data set.2 Violations of privacy, like re-identification, generally work by linking data from a de-identified data set with outside data sources. It is often surprising how little information is needed to re-identify a subject. More recent research has shown a different, and perhaps more troubling, aspect of de-identification. These studies have shown that the conclusions one can draw from a deidentified data set are significantly different from those that would be drawn when the original data set is used.1 Indeed, it appears that the process of de-identification makes it difficult or impossible to use a de-identified (and therefore easily sharable) version of a data set either to verify conclusions drawn from the original data set or to do new science that will be meaningful. This would seem to put big-data social science in the uncomfortable position of having either to reject notions of privacy or to accept that data cannot be easily shared, neither of which are tenable positions. This article looks at a particular data set, generated by the MOOCs (massive open online courses) offered through the edX platform by Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology during the first year of those offerings. It examines which aspects of the de-identification process for that data set caused it to change significantly, and it presents a different approach to deidentification that shows promise to allow both sharing and privacy. © 2015 ACM.",,Behavioral research; Big data; Data privacy; Data Science; Health insurance; Harvard University; Health insurance portability and accountability acts; Large amounts of data; Massachusetts Institute of Technology; Massive open online course; Re identifications; Recent researches; Regulatory regime; Data Sharing,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Bronze Open Access,Scopus

In looking for a potential way of responding to data scientists like Rudder, this article examines a 1948–50 essay about data that was written by Lionel Trilling (1905–75). Trilling frames data as part of our broader cultural history, which includes literature, drama, epic poetry, and the arts. This article argues that what Trilling models in the essay is a line of writing and thinking about data—a type of data criticism—that today offers tremendous promise for responding to data science and to evangelists like Christian Rudder. © 2016 by the University of Texas Press",,article; data science; human; human experiment; literature; publishing; sociology; thinking; writing,English,Article,Final,,Scopus

One of these nodes is at the National Computational Infrastructure (NCI) that provides a national comprehensively integrated high performance computing facility. NCI is a partnership between the ANU, the Australian Bureau of Meteorology, Geoscience Australia (GA) and the Australian Commonwealth Science and Industry Research Organisation (CSIRO) and particularly focuses on Earth system sciences. As part of its activity in RDS, NCI has collocated over 10 PBytes of priority research data collections spanning a wide range of disciplines from geosciences, geophysics, environment, climate, weather, and water resources, through to astronomy, bioinformatics, and the social sciences. To facilitate access, maximise reuse and enable integration across the disciplines, data have been built into a platform that NCI has called, the National Environmental Research Data Interoperability Platform (NERDIP). The platform is co-located with the significant HPC resources: a 1.2 PetaFlop supercomputer (Raijin), and a HPC class 3000 core OpenStack cloud system (Tenjin). Combined, they offer unparalleled opportunities for geosciences researchers to undertake innovative Data-intensive Science at scales and resolutions never before attempted, as well as enabling participation in new collaborations in interdisciplinary science. However, compared with other 'Big Data' science disciplines (climate, oceans, weather, astronomy), current geoscience data management practices and data access methods need significant work to be able to scale-up and thus to take advantage of the changes in the global computing landscape. Although the geosciences have many 'Big Data' collections that could be incorporated within NERDIP, they typically comprise heterogeneous files that are distributed over multiple sites and sectors, and it is taking considerable time to aggregate these into large High Performance Data (HPD) sets that are structured to facilitate uptake in HPC environments. Once incorporated into NERDIP, the next challenge is to ensure that researchers are ready to both use modern tools, and to update their working practises so as to process these data effectively. This is an issue in part because the geoscience community has been slow to move to peak-class systems for Data-intensive Science and integrate with the rest of the Earth systems community. © 2015 IEEE.",Big Data; Data Platforms; Data-intensive Science; Geosciences; High Performance Computing; High Performance Data,Bioinformatics; Data acquisition; Data integration; Geology; Information management; Interoperability; Supercomputers; Water resources; Data intensive science; Data platform; Geosciences; High performance computing; Performance data; Big data,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus

Although economic mechanisms are changed by data intensity, they can be redesigned to restore their benefits.We conclude with four cautions: if data are good, more may not be better; scientifically desirable data properties may not help policy; consent is a double-edged tool; and data exist only because someone thought to capture and codify them.

Some of the core commitments of existing research ethics regulations, such as the distinction between research and practice, cannot be cleanly exported from biomedical research to data science research. Such discontinuities have led some data science practitioners and researchers to move toward rejecting ethics regulations outright. These shifts occur at the same time as a proposal for major revisions to the Common Rule—the primary regulation governing human-subjects research in the USA—is under consideration for the first time in decades. We contextualize these revisions in long-running complaints about regulation of social science research and argue data science should be understood as continuous with social sciences in this regard. The proposed regulations are more flexible and scalable to the methods of non-biomedical research, yet problematically largely exclude data science methods from human-subjects regulation, particularly uses of public datasets. The ethical frameworks for Big Data research are highly contested and in flux, and the potential harms of data science research are unpredictable. We examine several contentious cases of research harms in data science, including the 2014 Facebook emotional contagion study and the 2016 use of geographical data techniques to identify the pseudonymous artist Banksy. To address disputes about application of human-subjects research ethics in data science, critical data studies should offer a historically nuanced theory of “data subjectivity” responsive to the epistemic methods, harms and benefits of data science and commerce. © The Author(s) 2016.",Big Data; Common Rule; critical data studies; Data ethics; human subjects,,English,Article,Final,All Open Access; Gold Open Access,Scopus

Italy has contributed to the launch of Big Data science in Europe. With more than eight hundred million quotes on Google, Big Data is one of the most cited technoscientific tags. Furthermore, since 2009, when Lazar and colleagues published the famous «Computational Social Science» on Science, Big Data science gave impulse to a new formidable endeavor: the creation of a new quantitative social science through the extensive application of Big Data science to the study of social phenomena. Now, a few years after the launch of the quantitative science of society, it is time for a first evaluation. Did Big Data maintain its promises? Does it still represent an opportunity for a new science of society? The answer provided in this paper is mildly positive. Big Data represents a good opportunity for the innovation of the social sciences on condition that (a) the application of data science to social data is global, rather than local, and oriented to policy, rather than profit-making; (b) the objective of predicting future events does not inhibit the complementary objective of science, i.e. explanatory speculation; and finally (c) quantitative science does not lead to dispense away with the understanding of the cognitive, social, cultural, and political mechanisms that generate social data.

High volumes of high-veracious, high-valuable data can be easily generated and collected at a high velocity from a high variety of data sources in various real-life applications in the fields of sciences and engineering, finance, social media, as well as online information resources. These big data have become an increasingly decisive resource in the modern society. Embedded in these big data are rich sets of useful information and knowledge. Hence, data intensive systems that provide data science solutions are in demand. In this paper, we propose a system that applies the MapReduce programming model to improve communication in social networks. Experimental results show the efficiency and effectiveness of the two improvement methods used in our proposed social system in reducing the number of communication hubs. These efficiency improvements not only lead to practical social network communications but also lead to the emergence of the cyber-physical-social interaction and computing. © 2015 IEEE.",big data; cyber and physical worlds; data intensive system; data mining; data science; frequent patterns; information propagation; MapReduce; social computing; social network analytics,Data mining; Efficiency; Information dissemination; Internet; Internet of things; Social networking (online); Social sciences computing; data science; Data-intensive systems; frequent patterns; Information propagation; Map-reduce; Physical world; Social computing; Big data,English,Conference paper,Final,,Scopus

Underlying assumptions for this research stream on predictive analytics are that social media actions such as tweeting, liking, commenting and rating are proxies for user/consumer's attention to a particular object/product and that the shared digital artefact that is persistent can create social influence. In this paper, we demonstrate how social media data from twitter can be used to predict the sales of iPhones. Based on a conceptual model of social data consisting of social graph (actors, actions, activities, and artefacts) and social text (topics, keywords, pronouns, and sentiments), we develop and evaluate a linear regression model that transforms iPhone tweets into a prediction of the quarterly iPhone sales with an average error close to the established prediction models from investment banks. This strong correlation between iPhone tweets and iPhone sales becomes marginally stronger after incorporating sentiments of tweets. We discuss the findings and conclude with implications for predictive analytics with big social data. © 2014 IEEE.",computational social science; Data science; iphone sales; iphone tweets; predictive analytics; social data analytics; twitter,Behavioral research; Data Analytics; Data Science; Economics; Forecasting; Investments; Mathematical transformations; Regression analysis; Sales; Smartphones; Social networking (online); Social sciences computing; Computational social science; iphone tweets; Linear regression models; Prediction model; Recent researches; Social media datum; Strong correlation; twitter; Predictive analytics,English,Conference paper,Final,All Open Access; Green Open Access,Scopus
